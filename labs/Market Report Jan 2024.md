## Trends on our Radar

Here are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community. This market report isn't exhaustive, at least just yet, with certain trends not yet listed such as Design, DevEx, etc. We see a lot of promising trends and we hope that understanding what engineers and firms are becoming more passionate about that it will help us create a foundation of ideas and knowledge.

### Simplifying the frontend experience - HTMX

HTMX is a library that simplifies HTTP request handling by making common functionality available via HTML attributes. On the React side, Next.js and Vercel have become extremely prevalent in every startup stack which has raised concerns of **vendor lock-in**, not to mention **increase in prices** for their services.

In addition, An, our Senior FE engineer, is also experimenting with an **HTML first approach to minimize the use of JavaScript (focusing more on HTML and CSS)** and has his radar set on HTMX. Likewise Thanh, our Engineering Manager, has mentioned a trend to change or look towards other libraries.

### Rise of in-house productivity and collaboration tools

The rise in in-house productivity tools is driven by the need for businesses to adapt to remote work, improve efficiency, facilitate collaboration, and enhance employee motivation and satisfaction.

On our side, we have one recent and a few other projects that touches on creating or advancing current productivity and collaboration tools, for social and business means. Although there are a myriad of tools, **there is not a single tool that rules them all** and fits the needs of specific use-cases for certain firms. There is a common trend to **move away from data silos and fragmented tooling to more highly integrated software**.

### A need for updating cybersecurity

With an increase in cybercrime and the [‘Mother of all breaches’](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/mother-of-all-breaches-data-leak-reveals-26-billion-account-records-stolen-from-twitter-linkedin-more/ar-BB1h8uz2), the demand for cybersecurity is higher than ever. Along with a growing **skill gap**, there will be initiatives for upskilling and reskilling know-how on cybersecurity. Internally, we have efforts for security hardening and monitoring to handle activites, incidents, and unusual traffic for physical devices.

### Trading bots

Across both the crypto world and general fintech, there is a growing demand trading bots and price watchers. Internally, our team has a handful of people who are investigating on programming trading bots, news aggregators, and price watchers for personal and general use. Likewise, there is a demand for copy trading for US stocks on winning traders, people in congress, and notable figures.

### Generally Available AI Virtual Assistants

Tightly coupled integration of data enrichment for AI virtual assistants has allowed them to become generally available as consumer products. Although not a new trend, AI with knowledge enrichment has been a growing effort across all industries. Along with integrated NPUs changing the hardware space for AI, integrated AI virtual assistants can now be deployed with vision detection on small devices
