We're entering a pivotal year. 2025 is the year of agentic AI, where everything becomes automated and development costs plummet. Startups are racing to build agents that replace repetitive work, and we're positioning ourselves right at the center of this transformation.

Our business model is straightforward: we sell our expertise, co-build with startups, help level up teams, and create custom solutions. But this year, we're doing it differently.

## Our focus areas for 2025

This year, we're betting big on four key areas:

- **[AI engineering & agentic systems](/arc/on-agent)** - Building the future of automated workflows
- **[Blockchain](/arc/on-blockchain)** - Powering decentralized solutions
- **[Platform engineering](/arc/on-platform)** - Creating robust, scalable infrastructure
- **[Spatial computing](/arc/on-spatial)** - Exploring new dimensions of user experience

## How we're organizing for success

We've spent three years experimenting and refining our approach. Now we're ready to formalize our chair-based leadership model. Think of chairs as department heads with more flexibility. Each chair takes ownership of a specific area, brings AI expertise to the table, and has the freedom to make things happen.

### [Learning chair](learning-chair.md)

Learning is our labs team. Their mission is simple: **pick up the newest tech, assess it, trial it, and then share it with the team**. This is critical to our identity as a [research-first](/updates/build-log/company), inbound-driven company.

The learning chair will grow our labs team and boost our content production. We'll create materials in multiple formats for learning, publication, and communication.

New initiatives:

- Treasury allocation for labs team
- Experiment-based approach with build-logs
- AI Apprenticeship batch 2025
- Unlock: AI as copilot for everyone

### [Delivery chair](delivery-chair.md)

Delivery is straightforward: we keep doing what we do best, but leverage new tech to **increase quality and ship faster**.

Key questions we're answering:

- How do we grow the delivery team?
- How do we control quality at scale?
- How do we measure delivery wins?

### [Communication chair](communication-chair.md)

We're doubling down on our research-first approach and **building our reputation** as an inbound engineering team. The goal is to use content from our learning team to build audience and attract talent.

New directions:

- Short video content for TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube
- Vietnamese translations for broader reach
- Developing our IP character for content consistency

### [Partnership chair](partnership-chair.md)

Our go-to-market strategy leverages all the content and research from learning and communication to **spot opportunities**.

Strategic partnerships:

- [WALA](/updates/wala) with established companies to explore AI use cases
- Partner with VCs to offer packages for AI startups
- Work with CTOs and PMs on retainer projects, leading to platform ops opportunities

### [Engagement chair](engagement-chair.md)

We're creating the best-in-class environment for our team. People need freedom to consult and co-build with partners while growing their skills.

With new tech breakthroughs happening, we want **more peer engagement**. We're also opening up ownership opportunities for everyone.

Key initiatives:

- [Hybrid working](/handbook/hybrid-working) - back to office with flexibility
- Gossip protocol for knowledge spreading
- DFG earning system via contribution weight
- New framework for talent recognition
