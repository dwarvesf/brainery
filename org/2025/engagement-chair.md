We're evolving our approach to combine the best of remote flexibility with in-person collaboration:

### Gossip protocol for knowledge spreading

Inspired by distributed systems, we're implementing a "gossip protocol" for knowledge sharing:

#### Implementation

- **Weekly knowledge shares** - Short presentations on interesting discoveries or learnings

4. **Flexible weighting** - Recognition that different roles contribute value in different ways
