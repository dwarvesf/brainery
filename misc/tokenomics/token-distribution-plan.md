Fair distribution builds trust and prevents concentration risk. The allocation balances community rewards, team incentives, and operational needs while maintaining long-term sustainability.

## Overview

The Dwarves+ Protocol token distribution plan outlines the strategic allocation of both ICY and DFG tokens to ensure sustainable growth, community development, and long-term protocol success. This document details the distribution mechanisms, vesting schedules, and allocation rationales.

## Distribution philosophy

### Core principles

1. **Community first**: Majority allocation to community and contributors
2. **Long-term alignment**: Vesting schedules that encourage sustained participation
3. **Fair distribution**: Equitable access for different stakeholder groups
4. **Growth incentives**: Allocations that drive protocol adoption and development
5. **Transparency**: Clear and public distribution mechanisms

### Strategic objectives

- **Decentralization**: Prevent concentration of token ownership
- **Incentive alignment**: Reward value creation and long-term commitment
- **Liquidity provision**: Ensure adequate token liquidity for healthy markets
- **Community building**: Foster strong, engaged community of contributors
- **Sustainable growth**: Support protocol development and expansion

## ICY token distribution

### Total supply management

- **Initial supply**: 100,000,000 ICY (100M)
- **Maximum supply**: 1,000,000,000 ICY (1B) - hard cap
- **Dynamic issuance**: 2-5% annual inflation based on protocol metrics
- **Burn mechanisms**: Regular token burns to maintain supply balance
