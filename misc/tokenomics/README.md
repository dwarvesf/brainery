This collection covers everything from high-level vision to technical implementation details. Start with the whitepaper for context, then dive into specific areas based on your interests.

## Overview

Dwarves+ Protocol implements a sophisticated dual-token system with Bitcoin-backed value layer designed to incentivize research, development, and community participation while maintaining sustainable economics and decentralized governance.

### Core tokens

- **ICY token** (Utility): Powers daily operations, contributor rewards, and protocol services - backed by Bitcoin treasury
- **DFG token** (Governance): Enables protocol governance, dividend collection, and long-term value accrual

### Bitcoin treasury layer

The protocol maintains a Bitcoin treasury that backs ICY token value through:

- **Regular Bitcoin purchases**: 10-15% of consulting profits converted to BTC monthly
- **Value floor**: ICY tokens have a dynamic value floor based on Bitcoin backing ratio
- **Transparent management**: Public dashboard showing real-time treasury metrics
- **Automatic buyback**: ICY buyback and burn triggered by Bitcoin treasury growth
