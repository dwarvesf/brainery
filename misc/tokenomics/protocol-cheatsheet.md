| **Backing** | Bitcoin treasury provides dynamic value floor |
| **Earning** | Research (100-2K ICY), Code (50-500 ICY), Community (10-250 ICY) |
| **Staking** | 5-20% APY (flexible to 24-month lock) |
| **Network** | Ethereum (governance) + Base (operations) |

## 🟠 Bitcoin treasury layer

### Treasury management strategy

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Funding source** | 10-15% of consulting profits → BTC purchases |
| **Purchase schedule** | Monthly dollar-cost averaging |

| **Value backing** | ICY tokens backed by Bitcoin treasury holdings |
| **Transparency** | Public dashboard with real-time metrics |

### ICY buyback & burn mechanisms

#### Automatic triggers

- **Bitcoin growth**: >20% monthly treasury growth → 5-10% ICY buyback
- **Profit surplus**: >150% average monthly profits → 25% excess to buyback

#### Governance controls

- **Quarterly burns**: DFG holders vote on 0.1-2% supply burns
- **Strategic burns**: 60% approval for market stabilization (max 5% annually)

### Public dashboard metrics

- **Bitcoin holdings**: Current BTC amount, USD value, purchase history
- **ICY backing ratio**: Dynamic value floor calculation
- **Treasury health**: Composition percentages and rebalancing status
- **Burn history**: Recent buyback and burn activities
