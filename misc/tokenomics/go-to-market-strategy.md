## Execution discipline

Marketing is easy to plan and hard to execute consistently. The strategy works if we stick to it through the messy middle months when growth feels slow and metrics look disappointing.

Success metrics matter more than vanity metrics. 50 active contributors who produce quality work beats 200 sign-ups who disappear after a week. We're building for retention and value creation, not just acquisition numbers.
