## General protocol questions

### What is the Dwarves+ protocol?

The Dwarves+ Protocol is a decentralized research and development platform that transforms traditional consulting into a community-driven protocol. We enable developers, researchers, and tech professionals to contribute to cutting-edge projects while earning tokens based on their contributions.

### How does Dwarves+ protocol differ from traditional consulting firms?

Unlike traditional consulting firms, Dwarves+ Protocol operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where:

- **Community ownership**: Contributors own governance tokens and share in protocol success
- **Transparent rewards**: All contributions are tracked and rewarded algorithmically
- **Open participation**: Anyone can join and contribute based on merit
- **Permanent knowledge**: Research and contributions are stored permanently on Arweave
- **Global access**: No geographic limitations or traditional employment constraints

### What makes Dwarves+ protocol unique in the web3 space?

- **Research focus**: Emphasis on high-quality technical research and innovation
- **Dual token system**: Separate utility (ICY) and governance (DFG) tokens for optimal economics
- **Activity chairs**: Structured governance through specialized activity committees
- **Permanent storage**: Integration with Arweave for immutable knowledge preservation
- **Quality standards**: Rigorous peer review and quality assurance processes

## Token economics

### What are ICY and DFG tokens?

**ICY (utility token)**:

- Used for daily protocol operations and contributor rewards
- Dynamic supply with 2-5% annual inflation
- Backed by Bitcoin treasury providing a dynamic value floor
- Earned through contributions to research, development, and community building
- Can be staked for additional rewards (5-20% APY)

**DFG (governance token)**:

- Fixed supply of 10 million tokens for protocol governance
- Provides voting rights on protocol decisions
- Entitles holders to dividend distributions (70% of protocol revenue)
- Required for submitting governance proposals

### How do I earn ICY tokens?

You can earn ICY tokens through various activities:

- **Research publication**: 70 ICY per publication
- **Code contribution**: 50-100 ICY per deliverable
- **Community engagement**: 10-50 ICY per activity
- **Mentoring**: 30 ICY per session
- **Partnership development**: 50-100 ICY per introduction
- **Quality assurance**: 10-100 ICY per review
- **Governance participation**: 100-500 ICY per vote

For detailed earning opportunities, see the [tokenomics documentation](README.md#contributor-rewards).

### What determines ICY reward amounts?

ICY rewards are calculated based on:

- **Contribution quality**: Peer review scores and impact assessment
- **Complexity**: Technical difficulty and time investment
- **Community value**: Benefit to the broader protocol ecosystem
- **Activity chair evaluation**: Assessment by relevant activity chair members
- **Multipliers**: Performance bonuses and achievement multipliers

### How does DFG token distribution work?

DFG tokens are distributed as follows:

- **Community treasury**: 25% (2.5M DFG) - Governance controlled
- **Core team**: 20% (2M DFG) - 48-month vesting
- **Public distribution**: 20% (2M DFG) - Community sales and airdrops
- **Early contributors**: 15% (1.5M DFG) - 24-month vesting
- **Liquidity provision**: 10% (1M DFG) - DEX liquidity
- **Strategic partners**: 10% (1M DFG) - Partnership agreements

### What are the staking rewards and requirements?

**ICY staking**:

- **Flexible staking**: 5-8% APY, no lock period
- **6-month lock**: 10-12% APY
- **12-month lock**: 15-18% APY
- **24-month lock**: 18-20% APY
- **Bitcoin backing bonus**: Additional rewards from Bitcoin treasury growth

**DFG staking**:

- **Governance staking**: 3-5% APY + voting power boost
- **Dividend staking**: Enhanced dividend distribution priority
- **Minimum**: 100 DFG tokens required for staking

### How does the Bitcoin treasury backing work?

The protocol maintains a Bitcoin treasury that backs ICY token value:

- **Funding**: 10-15% of consulting profits are converted to Bitcoin monthly
- **Value floor**: ICY tokens have a minimum value based on Bitcoin backing ratio
- **Calculation**: ICY Floor Value = (Bitcoin Treasury Value Ã— Backing Ratio) / ICY Supply
- **Growth benefits**: ICY holders benefit from Bitcoin price appreciation
- **Transparency**: Real-time treasury metrics available on public dashboard

### What happens when Bitcoin prices change?

**When Bitcoin appreciates**:

- ICY value floor increases proportionally
- Automatic buyback may be triggered (>20% monthly treasury growth)
- Long-term ICY holders benefit from Bitcoin appreciation
- Staking rewards may include Bitcoin appreciation bonuses

**When Bitcoin declines**:

- ICY maintains utility value independent of backing
- Stablecoin reserves (15-25%) provide operational stability
- Dollar-cost averaging continues to build long-term position
- Protocol revenue streams remain independent of Bitcoin price

### Is my ICY always worth the backing ratio amount?

No, the Bitcoin backing provides a **value floor**, not a fixed price:

- **Market price**: ICY trades based on utility demand and market conditions
- **Value floor**: Minimum value based on Bitcoin treasury backing
- **Typically**: Market price is higher than backing floor due to utility premium
- **Protection**: Backing prevents ICY from falling below treasury-supported value

## Governance & participation

### How does governance work in Dwarves+ protocol?

Governance operates through a structured system:

1. **Proposal creation**: DFG holders with 1,000+ tokens can create proposals
2. **Activity chair review**: Relevant chairs evaluate technical feasibility
3. **Community discussion**: 7-day discussion period
4. **Voting period**: 7-day voting with DFG tokens
5. **Execution**: Approved proposals are implemented automatically or by core team

### What are activity chairs and how do they work?

Activity chairs are specialized governance committees that oversee different protocol areas:

- **Engagement & integration**: Community building and HR functions
- **Delivery & consulting**: Client projects and service delivery
- **Learning & training**: Education and skill development
- **Marketing & communication**: Brand and outreach activities
- **Sales & partnership**: Business development and partnerships

Each chair has 5-7 elected members who serve 6-month terms and evaluate contributions in their domain.

### How can I become an activity chair member?

To become an Activity chair member:

1. **Minimum requirements**: 500+ DFG tokens and 6+ months of active contribution
2. **Nomination**: Self-nomination or community nomination
3. **Campaign period**: 2-week campaign with community engagement
4. **Election**: DFG token holder voting
5. **Term**: 6-month term with possibility of re-election

### What voting power do I need for governance participation?

- **Proposal creation**: 1,000 DFG tokens minimum
- **Regular voting**: 1 DFG = 1 vote (no minimum)
- **Activity chair elections**: 100 DFG minimum to vote
- **Emergency proposals**: 5,000 DFG tokens minimum
- **Constitutional changes**: 10,000 DFG tokens minimum
