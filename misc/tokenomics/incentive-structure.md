The incentive structure balances psychological motivation with economic rewards to create a thriving contributor ecosystem. By understanding what drives people to contribute their best work, we can build reward systems that feel meaningful and sustainable.

## Incentive design philosophy

### Core principles

1. **Merit-based rewards**: Compensation proportional to value created
2. **Intrinsic motivation**: Appeal to purpose, autonomy, and mastery
3. **Progressive recognition**: Increasing rewards for sustained contributions
4. **Collaborative culture**: Incentives that promote teamwork and knowledge sharing
5. **Long-term alignment**: Rewards that encourage sustained engagement

## Making it work

Success depends on balance. Too much emphasis on financial rewards can crowd out intrinsic motivation. Too little structure can lead to confusion and unfairness. The key is creating clear pathways for growth while maintaining the flexibility to recognize exceptional contributions that don't fit standard categories.

We'll track participation patterns, retention rates, and contributor satisfaction to refine these mechanisms over time.
