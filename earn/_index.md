## Earn and Bounty Program

Our earn and bounty program for all of the open-source work we do at Dwarves Foundation. A good portion of the earns and bounties help to improve quality-of-life for our community, creating bots and extensions for our messaging apps, and more serious work such as aggregating data from blockchains.
