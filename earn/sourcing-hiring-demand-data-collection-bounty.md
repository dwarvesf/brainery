## TL;DR

**Objective**: Build a data collection and analysis system to identify hiring trends and demands across multiple job platforms, providing insights into market needs and skill requirements.

## Key Points

- Multi-platform data collection (LinkedIn, Y Combinator's WorkAtAStartup, Indeed, AngelList)
- Real-time tracking of job posting trends
- Skill requirement analysis
- Salary range analysis
- Geographic distribution of demands
- Company size and stage correlation

## Core Requirements

The system will collect job posting data from major hiring platforms, focusing on technical roles and startup positions. It should track new postings, changes in demand patterns, and correlate data across platforms to identify genuine market needs rather than duplicate postings.

## Technical Specifications

The collection system will utilize available APIs and permitted data collection methods to gather:

- Job titles and descriptions
- Required skills and experience levels
- Salary ranges when available
- Company information
- Posting dates and duration
- Geographic location
- Remote work policies
- Company funding stage/size

## Privacy Measures

- Use only publicly available job posting data
- Follow each platform's terms of service
- Implement rate limiting and polite crawling
- Hash company identifiers where needed
- Store only relevant business data

## Implementation Details

The ETL pipeline will:

- Collect job postings from multiple sources
- Standardize job titles and skills across platforms
- Extract key requirements and preferences
- Identify salary ranges and compensation patterns
- Track posting lifetime and repost patterns
- Generate trend reports and demand forecasts

### Key Features

- Automated collection from major platforms
- Skill taxonomy mapping
- Salary range normalization
- Geographic demand mapping
- Time-series analysis of hiring trends
- Company stage/size correlation analysis

## Monitoring System

- Track data collection success rates
- Monitor API quotas and usage
- Alert on significant trend changes
- Track platform availability
- Monitor data freshness and quality
- Alert on collection failures

## Deliverables

- Data collection system with multi-platform support
- Processing pipeline for demand analysis
- Trend detection and reporting system
- Interactive dashboard showing: 
    - Hot skills and requirements
    - Salary trends
    - Geographic demand heat maps
    - Company stage analysis
- Comprehensive documentation including: 
    - System architecture
    - Data collection methodology
    - Analysis algorithms
    - Deployment guide
    - API documentation

## Success Metrics

- Coverage of major hiring platforms
- Data freshness (time from posting to collection)
- Accuracy of skill extraction
- Reliability of trend detection
- System uptime and collection success rates
- Quality of insights generated
- Platform quota efficiency

## Additional Considerations

- Handle varying posting formats
- Adapt to platform changes
- Scale with increasing data volume
- Provide real-time insights
- Support custom analyses
- Generate actionable reports
- Track emerging skill requirements
- Identify early market signals

## Conclusion

This bounty aims to create a comprehensive system for understanding the hiring market through data-driven analysis. The focus should be on generating actionable insights about market demands, skill requirements, and compensation trends while maintaining high standards for data quality and collection practices.
