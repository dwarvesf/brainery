#### Requirement: 

We have several internal and external events that happen in our Discord or happening outside, such as our Monday Radio Talk, Tech Talks we share with Webuild, TGIF, Summit, etc. It would be ideal to have a central calendar that aggregates all of these events into one place. This can be initially done visually through any calendar (like Notion), but eventually be easy to subscribe to through iCalendar or Google Calendar
