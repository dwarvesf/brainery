The Dwarves bounty program is the means through which both company peeps and the community can contribute to our daily activities. This includes tasks like building internal tools, engaging in new technology research and development, or sharing knowledge session.

This program is part of our ICY initiative, which you can learn more about at [handbook](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/blob/master/community/icy.md). ICY connects contributors with meaningful projects while rewarding valuable work across our ecosystem.

**â†’ To contribute**: open ticket in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/dfoundation) and give our mods a ping
