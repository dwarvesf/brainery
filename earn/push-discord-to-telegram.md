Last week, we announced about the reward system for fleetings notes, we understand that knowledge can come from everywhere: trainings, articles,... As there were thousand links shared in our channel #tech of our community, we want to take advantage of this activity to enrich our knowledge with the minimum effort. Therefore, we aim to build a feature in Tono bot which automatically transfer an endorsed link to a fleeting note. 

A link is eligible to be transfered to fleeting note when it has more than 5 star endorsed by community or when a member having senior role add to the fleeting note by the command /add-fleeting-note. 

This bounty expect you to deliver
- A command to transfer a link to a fleeting note: `/add-fleeting-note`.
- Automatically transfer a link having 5 stars and confirmed by the senior to a fleeting note.
- For every eligibile and confirmed article, automatically generate the summary from that and create a Pull request in which the summary file nested in folder [00_fleeting of playground](https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/tree/master/00_fleeting). 

**Follow this flow**
