### <span style='color:orange'>Engagement Model</span>

---

The work focuses on refactoring the Console dashboard app, improving the open-source package's quality, and tailoring brand UI for plugin consumers.

* <span style='color:orange'>Console dashboard app</span>: A platform that collects all data provided by user/ consumers to index and make their websites searchable. 
* <span style='color:orange'>Open-source package:</span> Search.io is now growing. They decided to start a series of open source libraries to make it developer-friendly. 

This makes Search.io more accessible to a broader audience and creates a frictionless searching setup.

* <span style='color:orange'>React SDK</span>: One of the libraries we develop and open source for public use, it is currently the main and most well-developed in the open-source series

Working with a growing team like Search.io, we ensure the stability to map with their current process. Plans and discussions are a must before every feature. Showcase demo happens on Friday to sync up the work and provide team feedback.
