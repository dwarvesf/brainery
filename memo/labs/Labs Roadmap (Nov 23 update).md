In a recent collaborative discussion between key members of the Labs and Consulting teams, we've made decisive strides in pinpointing key topics and potential projects for development. Each topic is paired with specific challenges to ensure we engage deeply with the technology, understanding its practical applications. The focal point for the coming month is WebAssembly (WASM), alongside a range of exciting use-cases we plan to implement and demonstrate.

Our discussions have led to the identification of several intriguing topics, each with its own set of challenges. It's particularly noteworthy how some of these topics intersect and overlap.

|Topic|PIC|Challenges|
|---|---|---|
|**WASM**|An Tran|- Self-host AI model on the browser (e.g. OCR for security cams, private browser chatbot...) <br> - Data processing and visual infographics (through DuckDB-WASM) <br> - Implement a Rust game through WASM|
|**Passwordless**|An Tran|- Biometrics on the web (through external device connection) <br> - QR code based login <br> - Magic Links|
|**Rust**|Hieu Phan|- Implementing a game server on Rust|
|**AI**|Tom|- Realtime memory knowledge updates (RAG updates)|
|**MPC**|Huy Nguyen|- Applying MPC for authentication for web3 (Console)|
|**UI practices**|Thanh Pham|- Build mochi-ui|

As we concentrate on these topics, other potential areas will stay in our backlog for the time being. However, these are open for exploration by members of the Labs and Dwarves teams, should they spark interest:

- Functional programming
- DX enhancement: Mock API development, devcontainer…
- Aspect-oriented programming
- CRDT vs OT
- cloudHSM
- Fullstack development/multipage application shift
- GA4
- DuckDB
- iFramely
- ziglang
- openid Zero Trust Infras/CI
- Self-hosted feature flag

We hope that the upcoming months will be promising. Not only do we aim to enhance our knowledge and skills, but we also hope that it will unlock new opportunities in our tech business. Let’s embark on this journey with excitement!
