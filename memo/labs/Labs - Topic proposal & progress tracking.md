Selecting the right R&D topics is crucial for our organization's growth. Currently, we are inviting topic proposals specifically from members of our labs, consulting and operation teams. These team members are chosen for their deep understanding of our business and their ability to envision the application of new technologies.

### ****Recording and Prioritizing Topics****

Our Labs team's key members will prioritize the proposed topics. These selected topics should be recorded on Basecamp within the Research project Hillchart. Remember to include a list of todos for effective progress tracking.

### ****Tracking Progress****

The progress of each topic is updated weekly on the Hillchart. The "Figuring things out" section indicates the Assess phase of a project, while the "Making it happen" section shows the Trial and Adopt phases. We also conduct monthly calls and meetings for planning, content approval, and to summarize progress.
