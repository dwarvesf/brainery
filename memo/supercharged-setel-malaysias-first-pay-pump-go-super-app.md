## Engagement Model 

---

We work as Conversion team - fully focused on <span style='color:pink'>**supporting the funnel to activate client**</span>.

Established businesses as Setel have a fixed protocol to work and operate. We need to form a team that can manage themselves independently and adopt modern business practices.
