*Hosted by Nikki - Dwarves' COO, and Thanh Pham - Engineering Manager, Dwarves had a great lineup and gleaned insights on the new wave of healthcare through the immense knowledge and practical experience through inspiring stories from Ms. Ruby Nguyen and Mr. Binh Le.*


### <span style='color:red'>**Start-up ideas come from your own needs.**</span>

---

“Momby started with the health needs of a pregnant mother and grew by understanding the worries of soon-to-be parents. Momby aims to provide a foundation for supporting knowledge, creating a safe and reliable space for expecting parents to freely learn, share, and help one another helping, thus making social impacts on Maternity care. On that journey, countless parents received timely supporting and evidence-based advice from Momby as it is today.”


### <span style='color:red'>**Developing software for the health market is a long-term goal.**</span>

---

“The health market has always needed an intense level of information accuracy, especially as Momby belongs in the maternity sector. Software helps users save time and shorten the distance from a consulting doctor. To do this effectively, Momby's engineering team must constantly experiment with updating and fitting a lot of data exactly to user needs. That's why transforming health with Momby is a long-term goal.”


### <span style='color:red'>**Being soft is not a problem for leaders.**</span>

---

“People think Ruby, with her soothing soft voice and gentle personality, is not fit for leadership. But during the sharing session, we all saw that Momby would not be complete without the loving and tender care of a mother. Ruby’s soft yet assertive voice talking about her passion, her career inspires teammates, along with her close communication with software engineers, has successfully proven to us that leading by inspiring, by caring does work wonder.”

### <span style='color:red'>**The most important thing is to start. All opportunities will open later if you follow the right path.**</span>

---

“Momby wasn't perfect at first, it only became more evident as we keep going. What we did best was to start it. Up to now, Momby has been well-received by the community, and we’re lucky enough to have many new opportunities to test many new strategies for the product. Thanks to that imperfect start, the teammates that founded Momby trusted, and continued to stay to carry out the mission of serving the community.”

### <span style='color:red'>**Young engineers, draw your own roadmap.**</span>

---

“A sincere share from a forerunner: young engineers, keep the courage to move forward, especially in tough times, and upgrade yourself day by day. There is magic in learning, trying, and trying again on your journey. Perseverance is a skill that can be learned to help you be more confident in what you’re capable of and help you shape out your own roadmap.”


At the end of the inspirational sharing session, we believe that everyone in the audience has their own ways to relate to these stories, but we hope everyone finds values in what was shared. And we hope you will continue to follow and support Momby with their journey. 

See everyone in the next event with many more talents.
