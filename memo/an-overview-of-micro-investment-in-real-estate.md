# How is the real estate market moving?

* When an industry begins this journey of digital transformation depends largely on the specific nature of its offering. As a rule of thumb, the more product-oriented and direct-to-customer an industry is, the sooner its digital transformation journey begins.

### The first important question is: why do industries go through this transformation process? What is the overall purpose?

* One common misconception is that fear is a major driver of transformation - the fear of being disrupted, the fear of becoming obsolete, the fear of losing out. Whilst it is true that fear drives action in some instances, the true driver behind digital transformation is capitalism in its most simple form - otherwise known as profit. Profit drives capitalism and, within regulatory and moral frameworks, a business must logically pursue profit at all cost and real estate can not stand outside this game although it can be considered as a business has been present for a long time and very stable since the human society was formed but not so that it stopped developing.
* In addition to the traditional word of mouth marketing, consumers are increasingly accessing real estate information via the Internet. Technology has a great impact on changing consumer behavior, promoting the application of technology in real estate. When customers' behavior changes, real estate businesses need to grasp this trend in order to increase access to customers, thereby increasing profits.

# Why does micro-investing form appear?

* The concept of micro-investing is a relatively new one. In the past, investing was reserved for only those with bulging wallets. In recent years, micro-investing has gotten very popular, particularly with millennials, born and raised in the technology era, this is a great opportunity just getting started with investing. Micro investing is the perfect way for millennials or any other generation to begin investing.
* So-called micro-investing in private real estate is an increasingly accessible option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with small-dollar value investments. By micro-investing, you’re investing small sums of money sometimes even just spare change and collecting returns slowly. You don’t really need any specific investing knowledge to start micro-investing

# How it works
