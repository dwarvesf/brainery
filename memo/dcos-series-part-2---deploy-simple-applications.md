There are so many interesting things in DC/OS GUI (`Dashboard` with useful metrics/status from all nodes, `Services` tab help us to know which application/service is running on which node, its status, etc.).

In this article, we will try to deploy applications to DC/OS and run it.

# Universe packages

The Universe tab shows all of the available DC/OS services from package repositories. You can install packages from the DC/OS Universe with a single click. The packages can be installed with defaults or customized directly in the web interface

# DC/OS CLI

You also can use the DC/OS command-line interface (CLI) to manage your cluster nodes, install DC/OS packages, inspect the cluster state, and administer the DC/OS service subcommands, deploy application, etc.

## Installing

You can quickly install the CLI from the DC/OS web interface.

1. Click Install CLI from the top-left corner of the DC/OS web interface

1. Copy and paste the code snippets into your terminal.

## Usage

To list available commands, either run dcos with no parameters or run dcos help

```javascript
Command line utility for the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating
System (DC/OS). The Mesosphere DC/OS is a distributed operating
system built around Apache Mesos. This utility provides tools
for easy management of a DC/OS installation.

Available DC/OS commands:

    auth               Authenticate to DC/OS cluster
    config             Manage the DC/OS configuration file
    experimental       Experimental commands. These commands are under development and are subject to change
    help               Display help information about DC/OS
    job                Deploy and manage jobs in DC/OS
    marathon           Deploy and manage applications to DC/OS
    node               Administer and manage DC/OS cluster nodes
    package            Install and manage DC/OS software packages
    service            Manage DC/OS services
    task               Manage DC/OS tasks

Get detailed command description with 'dcos <command> --help'.
```

OK. We will focus on command `dcos marathon app add <app-resource>`which help us deploy application to DC/OS

## Deploy a simple app

1. Create an app definition file named my-app.json with these contents

```javascript
{
    "id": "/nginx",
    "instances": 1,
    "cpus": 0.1,
    "mem": 64,
    "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
          "image": "nginx",
          "network": "BRIDGE",
          "portMappings": [
            {"containerPort": 80}
          ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Note**
By default, applications will be deployed to `private node`, so if you want to deploy to `public node`, you can add `"acceptedResourceRoles": ["slave_public"]` to `my-app.json`

1. Add your app to Marathon:

```javascript
$ dcos marathon app add <my-app.json>
```


If this is added successfully, output will be something like this:

```javascript
Created deployment d562b50a-17b0-44ce-b7d2-02a0c3cc799e
```



1. Verify that the app is added with this command:

```javascript
$ dcos marathon app list
```


The output can be look like this:

```javascript
ID      MEM  CPUS  TASKS  HEALTH  DEPLOYMENT  CONTAINER  CMD
/nginx   64  0.1    0/1    ---      scale       DOCKER   None
```



1. Check application on DC/OS GUI

Click on `Services` tab, you will see list of applications that you are running. To check applicationâ€™s information, just click on service and choose service ID that you want to see

As the picture above, you can check your application directly via `Endpoint`
