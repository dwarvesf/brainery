Requested by our Apprentices, and hosted by Thanh Pham - our Head of Web. Understanding an Application Design is the upfront work for every web project. An application design consists of different main parts, which we highlighted a few below.

## Type of Web Project

* Admin dashboard
* Client app(almost Listing app)
* Landing page

## Important Factors

The critical factors that helps define the right framework

* Type of Project
* Required SEO support
* State of Design: Sketch, Mockup, or Final design
* Cost for development
* Number of end-users: 10-100, 100-1000, >1000

## Rendering Technique

The process of taking HTML code and interprets it into visual results and interactive web pages. The technique can be chosen from three options

* SSR - Server side rendering: Supports SEO
* Hybrid rendering:
* Client side rendering: Only suitable for Single page app, and isn’t good for SEO.

## Atomic Components

The basic elements to construct a finetune website

* Color
* Font
* Grid system
* Typography
* Image
* Heading
* Content
* Link
* Button

## Choosing a framework vs Build things from scratch

* Choosing a framework: A framework provides productivity with presets. However, it’s a huge bundle size and may come with complexity during customization.
* Build from scratch: Takes more time and leads to low productivity. But in contrast, the website runs fast, and developers can actively optimize the performance

### Recommended Framework

* Ant-design: https://ant.design/: Suite for admin dashboard, desktop app. Huge bundle size.
* Tailwind CSS
* Bootstrap: CSS
* Next.js: web framework
