## Definition

Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a **compiled language**, yet remains **completely dynamic** – every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy **access to the Java frameworks**, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a **dialect of Lisp**, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

## Why Clojure

Clojure combines of:

* A Lisp
* for Functional Programming
* symbiotic with an established Platform
* designed for Concurrency

**I. Lisp is a good thing**

* Often emulated/pillaged, still not duplicated
* Lambda calculus yields an extremely small core
* Almost no syntax
* Core advantage still code-as-data and syntactic abstraction
* What about the standard Lisps (Common Lisp and Scheme)?
* Slow/no innovation post standardization
* Core data structures mutable, not extensible
* No concurrency in specs
* Good implementations already exist for JVM (ABCL, Kawa, SISC et al)
* Standard Lisps are their own platforms
* Clojure is a Lisp not constrained by backwards compatibility
* Extends the code-as-data paradigm to maps and vectors
* Defaults to immutability
* Core data structures are extensible abstractions
* Embraces a platform (JVM)

**II. Languages and Platforms**

* VMs, not OSes, are the platforms of the future, providing:
* Type system
* Dynamic enforcement and safety
* Libraries
* Abstract away OSes
* *Huge* set of facilities
* Built-in and 3rd-party
* Memory and other resource management
* GC is platform, not language, facility
* Bytecode + JIT compilation
* Abstracts away hardware
* Language as platform vs. language + platform
* Old way - each language defines its own runtime
* GC, bytecode, type system, libraries etc
* New way (JVM, .Net)
* Common runtime independent of language
* Language built for platform vs language ported-to platform
* Many new languages still take 'Language as platform' approach
* When ported, have platform-on-platform issues
* Memory management, type-system, threading issues
* Library duplication
* If original language based on C, some extension libraries written in C don’t come over
* Platforms are dictated by clients
* 'Must run on JVM' or .Net vs 'must run on Unix' or Windows
* JVM has established track record and trust level
* Now also open source
* Interop with other code required
* C linkage insufficient these days
* Java/JVM *is* language + platform
* Not the original story, but other languages for JVM always existed, now embraced by Sun
* Java can be tedious, insufficiently expressive
* Lack of first-class functions, no type inference, etc
* Ability to call/consume Java is critical
* Clojure is the language, JVM the platform

**III. Concurrency and the multi-core future**

* Immutability makes much of the problem go away
* Share freely between threads
* But changing state a reality for simulations and for in-program proxies to the outside world
* Locking is too hard to get right over and over again
* Clojure’s software transactional memory and agent systems do the hard part

### **Dynamic Development**

First and foremost, Clojure is dynamic. That means that a Clojure program is not just something you compile and run, but something with which you can interact. Clojure is not a language abstraction, but an environment, where almost all of the language constructs are reified, and thus can be examined and changed. This leads to a substantially different experience from running a program, examining its results (or failures) and trying again. In particular, you can grow your program, with data loaded, adding features, fixing bugs, testing, in an unbroken stream.

### **Dynamic Compilation**

Clojure is a compiled language, so one might wonder when you have to run the compiler. You don’t. Anything you enter into the REPL or load using load-file is automatically compiled to JVM bytecode on the fly. Compiling ahead-of-time is also possible, but not required.
