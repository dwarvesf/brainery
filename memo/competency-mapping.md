We identified skills and actions showing someone has one competency or not.

Six levels to measure the level of knowledge:
**0 – Completely unfamiliar**: *Doesn’t understand the competency.*
**1 – Novice**: *Understands the competency and its importance.*
**2 – Advanced Beginner**: *Demonstrates this competency under supervision or with encouragement.*
**3 – Competent**: *Demonstrates this competency independent of supervision or encouragement.*
**4 – Proficient**: *Encourages or supervises others in this competency.*
**5 – Expert**: *Develops new ways of applying this competence measured on the world stage.*

### **General User Research**

* Explain the importance of user research, not just before designing the product but also during design and after deployment.
* Identify the needed research methods and create a research plan.
* Deliver research insights in a structured way to promote research and keep accessibility in the future (e.g. research system or any other method).
* Understand how to write a hypothesis and how to control and measure variables.
* Find the target group and recruit users from the target audience.

### **User Needs Evaluation**

* Gain domain knowledge (competitor research, industry, cultural insights).
* Identify the best solution to summarize user needs and goals. Create personas or jobs-to-be-done sentences through interviewing potential users.
* Create a customer (and user) journey. Identify areas of improvement and communicate the journey to the rest of the company so they can understand where to add value.
* Plan and execute field research.
* Structure and conduct an effective interview that gets beyond the surface opinions (what users say) to reveal user goals (what users want).
* Report, analyze and present the discovery research results to the wider team.

### **Usability Evaluation**

* Use established usability principles and guidelines to predict likely problems in user interfaces before testing (heuristic evaluation).
* Plan and execute usability tests (e.g. moderated vs. unmoderated test, lab vs. remote test).
* Record, analyze and present the data from usability tests to the wider team.
* Prioritize usability problems based upon evidence.

### **Metrics and Measurements**

* Create a measurement plan according to the business and user goals (e.g. AARRR, HEART)
* Create surveys.
* Plan A/B tests.
* Understand how to implement effectively and the limitations of existing analytics. Cooperate with data analysts and developers during implementation.
* Analyze, interpret and report data from analytics, user surveys and customer support records.
* Pair metrics with qualitative data to understand users behavior behind the numbers.

### **Information Architecture**

* Carry out a card sorting and tree testing; analyze the results
* Analyze a journey map to identify and construct an information architecture.
* Breakdown large IA changes into small and comprehensible deliverables based upon resource constraints

### **Prototyping**

* Organize, structure and label content, functions and features using appropriate design patterns and create a screen flow.
* Explore multiple approaches to a problem before deciding on a solution.
* Create interactive, shareable prototypes to demonstrate and test a design solution.

### **Interaction Design**

* Understand the benefits of different user interface models and use them appropriately (e.g. knowing when to force a user down a guided path with a wizard or modal, or when to let them go their own way).
* Use the correct component from the pattern library to provide affordances and shape the user experience, e.g. choosing the correct control for an interface such as segment controller instead of a radio button.
* Understand established and evolving standards as well as best practices for human-computer interactions, and express them in our design language.
* Simplify the user interface by using animations where appropriate.
* Understand the opportunities and limitations of the technology that will express the design solution, and work with developers to determine its implementation.
* Document requirements and explain the expectations around an interaction (specification for the developers).

### **Visual Design**

* Use fundamental principles of visual design (contrast, alignment, repetition and proximity) to de-clutter user interfaces.
* Understand and use typography, icon, grid and color systems to lay out pages.
* Create illustrations that fit within our guidelines to reinforce and extend our messaging.
* Understand, use and evolve the common brand and design language and explain its importance (look and feel, moodboards, design guidelines).
* Create motion design animation.
* Collect and organize all the reusable complements guided by clear standards that can assemble to build any number of applications (Design System).

### **Writing**

* Create and edit macro and micro copy.
* Understand, use and evolve the common content and writing style (tone of voice), and explain its importance.
* Manage multiple languages to make it understandable for translators and content team and users.
* Establish harmony between written and visual communication.

### **Client Management**

* Plan and schedule work to prioritize and maximize delivery efficiency.
* Effectively explain and present the results of your team's work in a well structured way.
* Engage and maintain communication with stakeholders; manage their expectations.
* Promote the value of design thinking; grow the client’s user-experience competency.

### **Professional Cooperation**

* Learn to make modifications in work methods, processes in case unexpected issues.
* Cooperate with other team members; constructively critique their work and collaborate for a common path.
* Promote and support the team’s ongoing professional development.
* Cultivate a team with strong interpersonal relationships (know and manage people).
* Simplify collaboration with developers in an agile way; provide specifications.

### **Business and Strategy**

* Understand and support the client in business plan decisions; understand the business model and monetization opportunities.
* Explain the cost-benefit of user experience and design activities to the business and make suggestions how to measure and monitor their effects on their success.
* Feature prioritization; support the client in product strategy considering the related impact and effort needed.

### **Development**

* Web development (HTML, CSS)
* Web development (Javascript)
* Android development
* iOS development

### **Workshop Facilitation**

* Find the right method and tools; create a workshop plan for the product need and know how to modify when unexpected issues come up.
* Soft skills: Handle different personalities, time management, assertive communication, support the team decision.
* Effectively synthesize the information and push the participants towards their workshop goals (effective decision making and action plan).
* Ensure participants understand the workshop’s outcome and take further actions.
