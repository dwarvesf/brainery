### <span style='color:yellow'>In brief</span>

* <span style='color:yellow'>**beCorporate**</span> is a module to manage and optimize in-house business transports for employee. 
* They look to ship in short timeline. The current engineering team was working on the 1st release of ride-hailing app. Wrap-up beCorporate adds a step in perfecting their service.
* We augmented them with 6 Dwarves, working collaboratively to speed up the product development.

### <span style='color:yellow'>Technical Highlight</span>

* Golang-backend system for team-scale support
* System design: Microservice architecture
* System integration with new module development
* Business logic adjustment 

### <span style='color:yellow'>The Context</span>

<!-- column_list 4b43e3bf-66ed-4040-92fd-4c7656262c16 -->

<!-- column 4d7b45ea-a269-4674-b9cf-239c80df3ebb -->

<span style='color:yellow'>**beCorporate**</span> is tailored for enterprises. Employees can register, schedule and book vehicle for business transports via <span style='color:yellow'>**beApp**</span>, either as a group or as an individual. The initial launch gained a lot of traction and traffics. It drives the development team to their busiest stage.

Their release timeline for <span style='color:yellow'>**beCorporate**</span>Â couldn't change due to the business roadmap. The market was welcoming <span style='color:yellow'>**beApp**</span>, and was ready to see more. 

Back in 2018, it was challenge to build an in-house team of experienced Golang developers. With that timeline, <span style='color:yellow'>**be**</span> needs a team partner to get things done fast. Hiring for more hands wasn't an option. There was no time for recruitment, onboarding, or tech stacks training. 


ðŸ”‘ We were one of the first teams in Vietnam that picked up Golang as the strategic language. That's how our partnership began. 


### <span style='color:yellow'>Engagement Model</span>

---

<span style='color:yellow'>**beCorporate**</span> was sketched up with 2 ideals architectures. We must find where to input the module. Would it better be stand alone, or integrated as a service within be's Cloud ecosystem?

* The stand alone: Modern enterprise solutions without compromising stability and reliable. 
* The ecosystem: Ensures how beCorp fits into the big picture of the current infrastructure. 

We figured integrating <span style='color:yellow'>**beCorporate**</span> into the ecosystem was more reasonable. Users are capable of experience other services. Hence, microservice was the final option for system architecture.
