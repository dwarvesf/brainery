## Introduction

BHD is one of the biggest cinema chains in Vietnam with hundreds of thousands tickets sold monthly. However, its mobile application is a complete drawback; users cannot book tickets online, it feels and looks outdated, inconsistent and cluttered.

### Mission

BHD’s new app covers all the basic needs of movie-goers, in an intuitive and pleasant way. Meaning, users can easily scan screening schedules, view movie details and book tickets online.

### Goal

1. Provide users with information on movies, schedules, locations, promotions all in one space.

2. Allow users to book and pay for their tickets online.

## The Challenges

**The new design** needs to change users’ current perception of BHD app, by providing users with **a seamless and straight-forward experience.**

### Home screen - Schedule

What movies are playing at the theater? Is that movie too long to watch? Providing answers to these common questions is the top priority of this screen. The old one didn’t offer this info and our proposed solutions are:

1. A bigger and better transition effect for the movie carousel to make the browsing more enjoyable
1. Eye-catching CTA button to encourage booking
1. Moving the promotion banners beneath movies to prioritize the main task

### Showtime

When picking showtime, it is important to group them by order: time - location - type of theater. Must-have data is also highlighted for best scanning:

* Date of the showtime - today as the default state, going back to the previous days is not permitted to prevent mistakes.
* City in which the cinemas locate - only 3 cities available so showing all should be better than hidden in a combo box.
* Start time - optimized with horizontal scroll to help users perceive info and make their booking decision quickly.
