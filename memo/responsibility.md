Operations people are the reason customers are happy, vendors continue providing you with services, and employees have enough resources.

**Operations team is the “A**-**team” of vision logistics and their** #1 mission is to take care of the organization (feed it, protect it, and maintain it)

It is much easier to climb a mountain when someone has already laid out the map, obtained all the supplies, made sure weather is optimal, and has an emergency response ready to go, if needed. When all the little details are taken care of, then you only have to focus on obtaining your peak physical condition – the logistics help enable your success. **Operations is probably one of the most demanding functional areas, because the company never stops working and you rarely do too**

The day-to-day execution and administration of a business often takes an excessive amount of time

Operational execution also requires a skillset and related ultra-efficiency (and pattern recognition) that is often the polar opposite of what is required to create innovative/competitive products and lead the vision of the business

The founders realized they were building a sky-scraper on a small house foundation. What was acceptable for a team of 5 was no longer working for 10, 15, 50, 100, etc. A good Operations Executive will bring the best practices, discipline, and a systematic approach to growing the company. He/she will also build a strong foundation without destroying the one the company was built on

"You know what is your ultimate recognition? No one knows what things you make happen every day! If they do, you failed! Your job is to catch someone from messing up, your job is to make sure everything is running smoothly, your job is to clean up after you know what hits the fan. Your job is to make sure the government is happy, and most importantly is to make sure your people think that this is the best company EVER!"

Operations people are the “moms and dads” of the companies. **The best ones are “Swiss army knives” with battle scars and ingenuity**
