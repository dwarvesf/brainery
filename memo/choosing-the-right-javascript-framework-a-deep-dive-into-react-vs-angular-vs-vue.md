# A brief history of modern frontend development

Embarking on a journey through the history of frontend development, we first encounter jQuery, a groundbreaking JavaScript library released in 2006 that simplified the process of constructing interactive web applications. As jQuery gained traction, so did the concept of Single-Page Applications (SPAs), which enabled web apps to dynamically rewrite pages without the need for loading new pages entirely. This transformation in web development can be attributed to the ongoing refinement and structuring of front-end frameworks.

In 2010, AngularJS emerged as a pioneer in the world of frontend development, introducing revolutionary concepts such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and modular architecture. These features facilitated the creation of maintainable, testable, and scalable applications for developers.

React, a brainchild of Facebook, was unveiled in 2013 and rapidly gained favor for its effective approach to building user interfaces with reusable components. Pioneering a new way to develop SPAs using the Virtual DOM, React enabled enhanced performance and more efficient updates. The framework's component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, and thriving ecosystem made it an instant hit among developers.

Angular, first launched in 2016 as a comprehensive rewrite of AngularJS, assimilated the lessons learned from its precursor and further refined them. Providing a stable, built-in solution without sacrificing size or speed, Angular quickly carved out a niche in the development community.

In 2014, [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi), who previously worked at Google and built applications with AngularJS, unveiled Vue, a progressive frontend framework explicitly tailored for crafting intricate user interfaces and views. Vue amalgamated the best aspects of React and Angular, presenting developers with a versatile, lightweight, and potent alternative.

# Detailed comparison: React vs Angular vs Vue

## Rendering Performance

**React**: React is renowned for its virtual DOM, which enables it to efficiently update and render components by comparing the changes with the actual DOM. This results in excellent rendering performance, particularly in large-scale applications. Additionally, React incorporates [concurrent rendering](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react), which further optimizes the rendering process by prioritizing updates based on their importance.

**Angular**: Angular utilizes a real DOM and leverages [ahead-of-time](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler) (AOT) compilation and change detection mechanisms to optimize rendering performance. These features, combined with zone.js for efficient change detection, have significantly improved Angular's performance over time. However, it can still struggle with complex applications, particularly when dealing with frequent DOM updates.

**Vue**: Vue amalgamates the best of both worlds by using a virtual DOM for efficient updates and reactive data binding for quick DOM manipulations. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly performant in smaller applications, but it scales well to larger projects too. Vue 3 introduced the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq), which further improves performance by facilitating more granular control over-reactivity and optimization.

## Learning Curve

**React**: React has a moderate learning curve due to its unique JSX syntax and functional programming concepts, such as hooks and higher-order components. However, the vast community support, extensive documentation, and popularity in the industry make it easier to find resources and learn quickly. React's flexibility also allows developers to adopt different patterns and architectures based on their preferences.

**Angular**: Angular has a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners, as it involves understanding concepts like dependency injection, decorators, and TypeScript. Its comprehensive nature as a complete framework might require more time to become proficient. However, Angular's strict structure and best practices can help developers maintain a consistent codebase in large projects.
