# Introduction

The following case study is my first app design project. In this project, I have gone through the design process, including interviews, analysis, user flows, wireframes, prototyping, and user testing.
The mobile app Sol is a travel app focused on some highlight features: planning trips, managing members and expenses, and tracking/sharing location. In facts, when traveling by groups, we often face some troubles: getting lost, confusing with plans, hard-communicating and the most challenging thing: managing expenses. This app provides some solutions to these problems.

# Target market

Potential users of this app are Global travelers who are young, hi-tech and love backpacking with groups of friends. Users will be connected by Social Network (first we will try with Facebook, the most famous Social Network), they can find location and track their friends while traveling using map in-app. They can also send STOP notification to their groups when they have trouble while moving.

# User Research

## Interview

To understand usersâ€™ needs, pain points and behaviors, I met and interviewed some people, who are young and loves travel. Through these interviews, I gathered some information, mainly about the troubles they often encounter when travel by groups.

## Survey Questions Asked:

* How old are you?
* What does your typical day look like?
* What are some of the apps you use on a regular basis?
* How often do you travel with friends?
* Where are you most interested in traveling to next?
* Tell me about the kinds of experiences and activities you like to do when traveling with friends.
* How do you use your phone for travel?
* While planning travel, or traveling, what do you want and need your travel apps to do for you?
* What is your biggest pain point related to manage your trip planning and expenses during traveling?
* Did you make something to manage your trip with friends easier?
* How did you do?
* What apps or sites do you usually go to for manage your trip?
* What do you like or dislike about these other apps?
* How can you find your group members while moving or getting lost?
* Final questions, comments?

During these interviews, I found people enjoy because they love to travel, they love exploring new places. They have to face some typical problems while going on a trip with their friends, about managing plans, expenses and location. And, this was how I started my project.

## Personas

Using my interviews I combined my findings to create three personas that would be typical users of Sol.
