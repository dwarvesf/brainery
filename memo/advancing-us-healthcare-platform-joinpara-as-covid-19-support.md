<span style='color:blue'>**Team size**</span>

The Dwarves initially joined in with 1 Backend Engineer. Working together with Para team, we helped build a sturdy backend system to sort out different logics. 

Para's app serves multiple purposes and deals with a loaded volume of data. We went for a <span style='color:blue'>microservice architecture built from Go.</span>

When the system has been set up, our Designer and her director stepped in. Using Figma & Sketch, we delivered a stunning brush-up for Para's mobile app's interface. The app covered both Android & iOS versions for a wider user segment. Then our Frontend Engineer continued turning those canvas into a digital display. 

Throughout the process, we keep 1 PM in the team to oversee and provide on-time consultancy. With a team of 5, we stayed aligned and respected Para's business goal to maintain flexibility during the development stage.
