## In brief

* Founded in 2019, Para is a platform connecting hospitals with medical professionals. 
* Continuing with Go microservices, we have shipped numerous features, markedly workshift management and candidate screening. We partnered and helped unburden Para from the financial stress during the early stage of <span style='color:pink'>their MVP development.</span>
* Our Covid-19 program was launched in early 2020. We aim to provide software development, technical support for startups and businesses to help them stay stable during and progress forward despite the pandemic.

Para was in a rushing period. They saw a demand for its product peak when Covid-19 hit severely. Nutriment products and healthcare services are essentials. The roadmap was clear and concise. They seek a team to quickly work and conclude the remaining features. Speed up the development phase is the top priority.

## Engagement Model

**<span style='color:pink'>Team size</span>**

The Dwarves initially joined in with 1 Backend Engineer. Working together with Para team, we helped build a sturdy backend system to sort out different logics. 

Para's app serves multiple purposes and deals with a loaded volume of data. We went for a <span style='color:pink'>microservice architecture built from Go.</span>

When the system has been set up, our Designer and her director stepped in. Using Figma & Sketch, we delivered a stunning brush-up for Para's mobile app's interface. The app covered both Android & iOS versions for a wider user segment. Then our Frontend Engineer continued turning those canvas into a digital display. 

Throughout the process, we keep 1 PM in the team to oversee and provide on-time consultancy. With a team of 5, we stayed aligned and respected Para's business goal to maintain flexibility during the development stage.
