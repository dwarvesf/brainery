### <span style='color:blue'>The Context</span>

---

Relay was in the early stage. Hetong, the PO, stated clearly she needed a viable version with basic features.

The MVP must be finished fast and clean for potential customer acquirement and seeding round.

It must be done fast. And the requirement can be changed as market demands. Due to that, Hetong wants a team to quickly pick up the product context and be ready to adjust along the way. Meanwhile, keeping a stable pace for feature shipment.


ðŸ”¹ The context changes. We change accordingly


### <span style='color:blue'>**Engagement Model**</span>

At first, we were expected to join them for the first few months. As the product goes, the trustworthy collaboration escalated that we could involve more in the development process. They welcome us to contribute the idea instead of just getting the tasks done.

Relay places their effort on development pace and reuses what's helpful to speed up the development progress. 

The combo of React, TailwindCSS and Storybook allows us to get that done with no sweat.



<span style='color:blue'>**Communication**</span>

Slack is definitely for team communication, while Notion is perfect for documents management. 

We take Trello onboard for task management, while all the designs are stored in Figma. 


### <span style='color:blue'>**Outcome**</span>
