## <span style='color:red'>The talent pool</span>

Dwarves are backed by the talent pool. We‚Äôre selective for those that are in the funnel. Like-minded people and their unique values stay above everything. Therefore, we run a significant adjustment on the admission principle: To pass the probation means the current Dwarves accept you.

## <span style='color:red'>The 3 out of 4 principle</span>

We‚Äôre divided into 4 kinds of association:

* Project member: The people you are directly working with.
* In the chapter: The career track you belong in. i.g: Backend, Frontend, Design,‚Ä¶ etc
* Mentor: The upper layer that provides advice, suggestion & feedback
* Social: Your friends at work.

When the time comes, we will require you to submit the 3 upvotes/ reviews from these mentioned kinds. By having this, you‚Äôre stepping into the door of becoming a Dwarves. It requires you to get along with your peers, knowing you are both running toward the mutual target, and working on the engine of innovation.
