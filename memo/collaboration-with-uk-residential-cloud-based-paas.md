### <span style='color:blue'>In brief</span>

* Founded in 1997 and has having 22 years in the market, Reapit is the largest CRM and Client Accounting software provider to the UK residential real estate sector.
* Reapit got acquired by Accel KKR in 2017 - which powered them to accelerate their growth and innovation potential in products and technology expansion
* Reapit wants to migrate the app from desktop-based to Cloud-based. They want to develop a PaaS to support an expandability for SME customer. 
* We stepped in as a Vietnam offshore team for prototypes and <span style='color:blue'>skunkworks</span>. Skunkworks demands minimum team management, able to ship work in short timeline and scaling ability. 

### <span style='color:blue'>Technical Highlight</span>

### <span style='color:blue'>The Context</span>

They currently have 60 engineers in the UK. But they need <span style='color:blue'>augmentation</span> to grow faster. A skunkworks team is perfect for that. 

We take over the module development as part of SME solutions. This enables Reapit to trial new ideas for their upcoming launch event: Reapit Foundation.

Normally, building up a team needs an interference of headhunter, service fee and time to get people onboarded. 


✔️ We tackle that with a team of skillful engineers. Reapit was thrilled to form an Asia offshore team for scaling possibility.

SLA is also a part that we help qualify. More than the code, we offer long term tech strategy.

We form up a Cloud-team with senior React.js. We dive in to take care 2 focuses of AgencyCloud:

* <span style='color:blue'>Reapit's Foundation</span>: Cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and app marketplace
* <span style='color:blue'>Reapit's Geo Diary</span>: On-the-go app for instant access in daily & weekly appointments.

Reapit's Foundation contains of 3 main apps: Admin Portal, Developer Portal and App Marketplace (in which consists of Geo Diary and AML Checklist). Having multiple apps is hard to handle the codebase. We initiatively suggest them monorepo as a united solution.

* Sprint Planning: Milestone discussion and weekly focus.
* 4PM Daily meeting: Work status sync-up and problem-resolve.
* Bi-weekly Sprint Update: Previous-sprint walk through and new tickets clarification.
