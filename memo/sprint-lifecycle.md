## **Sprint "milestones"**

Below listed are the rules for each step of the sprint lifecycle. ***No exceptions will be made for any of the points.***

**Start of the sprint**

* The sprint will start at the end of the sprint planning.
* Before the start of the sprint planning, engineers will be focused on the same set of actions as on the Friday of the second week of the sprint. (See below)

**End of the sprint**

* The sprint is automatically closed on the second Thursday of the sprint at **6:00 PM**
* All the tickets that aren't closed will go back at the top of the backlog
* After the end of the sprint the actions for the engineers will be:
* Prepare improvement notes (if not discussed with the team) and tickets for the sprint planning
* Continuous learning

### Code release + Release notes

* The code will be tagged and released as per the release flow on Friday morning after the end of the sprint
* The releases notes will be produced and given to the product team on Friday morning after the end of the sprint
* Only the tickets that are closed when the sprint ends will be included in the release

### Deployment on staging

* The code release will be deployed on our *internal* staging on Friday
* The code release will be deployed on the customer's staging Tuesday morning after the end of the sprint.
