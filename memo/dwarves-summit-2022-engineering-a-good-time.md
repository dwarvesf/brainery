# Dwarves Summit 2022: Engineering a good time.

We don‚Äôt treat team bonding the common way, because we understand our engineers. Most of our engineers don‚Äôt want running and getting sweaty on the beach for ‚Äúteam-building‚Äù activities, or pretending to smile in front of the travel agent‚Äôs camera.

This was our first company get-together after 2 years of COVID. It was organized in ways that we can all look back to the progress we‚Äôve made, pat ourselves on the back, have a blast together, and look forward to an even better 2023.


## Remote First Company

We started with *Remote OK* back in 2017, following 37Signals, our tech crush at that time. In 2021, COVID took how we work to the next level.  Since 2021, we have transitioned from a *Remote OK* to a **Remote first company **(except for some teammates due to the client‚Äôs security requirements). Our internal processes and engineers‚Äô soft skills have been upgraded tremendously, making sure we perform smoothly across multiple timezones and geographies.


---

## Team scale

Growing cross-functional teams at Dwarves is challenging, but it‚Äôs rewarding getting to collaborate with like-minded peeps. We‚Äôve seen 1.5x growth of our team to a total of just over 100 team members, and everyone has given us unexpected and incredible results. 

Although it‚Äôs short of our 2022 goal of 2x the team, we‚Äôre very proud nonetheless.


**In 2022 alone, we:**

* Received 400+ applications 
* Invited 91 engineers for interviews
* Onboarded 29 new teammates

While the ratio of ~0.07% is astounding, it speaks standards and quality. We are selective with who joins the team. Anyone who joins us, it‚Äôs a given they are pro at their jobs, they also need to love the culture we are working hard to protect and build up.


---

## Partner & Business Growth

We never pay a single cent to run ads, and rarely ever participate in pitching for new projects. Clients come to us through their networks and connections. Someone works with us, happy about our services, they refer us when someone else has a need.

In 2022, we grew to 6 partners who are willing to refer our services. These partners brought in 5 new projects, at a referral rate of 5-12% over the generated revenue.


---

## Community Growth

We‚Äôve been active in a few communities, such as the Golang community, Webuild, Techie stories, Startup.vn.

Most especially, Dwarves Discord Network where every techie can join to hang out and learn has grown to 600+ members.

We‚Äôve seen various tech-focused channels and events for the community,  as well as ways for everyone  [learn and earn](https://earn.d.foundation/). 

* **#engineering**: share our software know-how, programming advice, and technical insights.
* **#learning-topics:** our knowledge sharing system, where the Dwarves keep their learning, discoveries and helpful practice to build quality software.
* **#blockchain:** where to find the knowledge piece to build the social layer for blockchain ecosystem.
* **#campfire:** off-topics connect with our friends, alumni, and like-minded people.
* **#minigame**: our Thursday minigame and happy hour for the Dwarves and communities. We work and have fun.

Since we‚Äôre engineers, we know it would be more fun to create apps and games as a way to bond as a company outside physical activities. It was definitely a challenge to organize the games for everyone, but we certainly had a blast.

We took the opportunity to just drink and have fun, as well as help teams earn a bit for their efforts. We‚Äôve also certainly enjoyed our stay in Phu Quoc as well. Our team had fun swimming near the coast, enjoying food, riding rides at the water park, and everything to explore at Phu Quoc.

# Look forward to Dwarves Summit 2023

---

We‚Äôre really happy on how Summit 2022 turned out. We‚Äôve had quite a lot of fun together as a team, and we are really excited about next year.

Likewise, we‚Äôve learned a lot during the trip and have taken a few steps ahead in planning for our next trip.

* **Activities developed for engineers, by engineers. **We want our people to have true, meaningful fun, so we want to open opportunities to our team to take part in develop games for not just our next trip, but for everyone to enjoy.
* **International trips.** With the pandemic settling down globally, we will definitely have a look at places we haven‚Äôt been to and explore them together.
* **Even bigger incentives.** Allow everyone to earn and have fun doing so.
* **Albums and videos for everyone to look back to.** Have memories where everyone can take home, and enjoy watching and brag to their friends about.

Our goal for next year is to incorporate **Mastery, Meaning, and Autonomy**. These are some of the things we have in our backlog, and we‚Äôre certainly excited to try out more when we get to it.

Here‚Äôs to the restart of our adventures together and to many more experiences and opportunities for 2023!

If what we do for our team excites you, <span style='color:red'>**[we are always hiring and expanding the team](http://careers.d.foundation/)**</span>.
