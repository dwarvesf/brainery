When using Docker, you will quickly realize that the image using to run a project takes a big capacity. A simple image ubuntu took nearly 200MB, but you donâ€™t take full advantage of its available tools. Other images like Node, Go, etc almost run in Ubuntu, debian and only set up more environments to easily deploy. However, downloading a new image takes more time because of its big capacity and it seems to be not necessary at all.


I found an empty image, except some added metadata by Docker

```javascript
docker pull scratch
```

Therefore, this Docker image has the smallest capacity

## How to deploy an app web with this Docker image

* I will demo with beego web.
* I cannot compile app go in this empty image because it has no Go complier. And while using Mac, I cannot compile a Linux library. In reality, we absolutely can cross-compile but I will not mention in this blog. You can refer to [here](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment)
* So I need to create an environment to compile and docker build source Go

```javascript
docker run --rm -it -v "$GOPATH":/go  -e "GOPATH=/go"  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):$(which docker) golang bash
```

* With the above command, `-rm` will delete container after exit,`v "$GOPATH":/go` share directory GOPATH to container, `e "GOPATH=/go", -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` is used to run Docker into container (docker in docker). `v $(which docker):$(which docker)` is used to share command docker, golang is image environment to build Go binary and build image, bash to begin Bash session.
* This time, because I went into container, I cd to project `/go/src/git.dwarvesf.com/ivkean/web.`
* Create a Dockerfile with the content below

```javascript
# scratch
FROM scratch

WORKDIR /web

# copy binary into image
COPY web web

# copy other necessary files
COPY conf conf
COPY static static
COPY views views

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/web/web"]
```



* Build source by command: `go build`
* And link library by:`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o web .`
* Build with docker: `docker build -t beego-web .`

* Creating an image only takes 17.5MB
