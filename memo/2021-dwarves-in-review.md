# Wrapping up Dwarves 1.0

2021 is full of changes and challenges, but our can-do mindset makes us gritty. We don't have all the answers, so we try and do. As we state in our <span style='color:yellow'>**[Agile Minifesto](https://dwarves.foundation/manifesto)**</span>: Fail fast, learn often, and it's okay to start over.

The results are way beyond our expectations. We work with several great clients and partners, including <span style='color:yellow'>**[Setel](http://setel.com/)**</span>,<span style='color:green'>** **</span><span style='color:yellow'>**[Momos](http://momos.io/)**</span>, <span style='color:yellow'>**[Mudah](http://mudah.my/)**</span>, <span style='color:yellow'>**[Attrace](http://attrace.com/)**</span>, <span style='color:yellow'>**[SP Group](http://spgroup.com.sg/)**</span>, <span style='color:yellow'>**[Vietcetera](http://vietcetera.com/)**</span>, <span style='color:yellow'>**[WeBuild](http://webuild.community/)**</span> and many more. We automate most of our operations using Notion, Basecamp, and our very own Fortress. We form a team specialized in blockchain & web3. 

And along with everything, we do everything we can to level up our team.

# A few things worth celebrating

### <span style='color:yellow'>The team benefits go up</span>

The Dwarves are our greatest asset. Most of our effort goes into hiring the right ones, giving them absolute support to grow with us.

<!-- column_list 0c58eea6-bf8e-4136-a7ab-994d691a9888 -->

<!-- column 3a998f40-59e3-465f-b6f5-1606afc7ef9c -->

* The Dwarves recently enjoyed a significant raise in compensation.
* With Dwarves Token, everyone contributing to our growth gets rewarded a portion of the company.

<!-- column 6c03f009-ff5e-44a8-af70-7dc6a6ba1ffb -->

* The engineer career ladder was refined with 1-1 mentoring.
* We offer more internal training, and the team keeps inputting their valuable piece of Knowledge

By launching <span style='color:yellow'>[Dwarves Discord](https://discord.gg/dwarvesv)</span>, we’re able to connect and interchange our knowledge with the people who care about tech as much as we do. 


![[eb05959ef1c030328fba76afd1a971ce_MD5.webp]]


### <span style='color:yellow'>Making our marks in new tech</span>

New technologies shape the future. It's our all-time belief. Within this year, our bet is on the Web3, the Open Internet, and the next-gen automation software using AI and Big Data.

<!-- column_list 9d4f18c3-ccd7-4c8d-b645-97e3b2fed6f1 -->

<!-- column e92c6ded-a05a-4ee0-b3fd-1b4d28a7505a -->

* A blockchain-specialized & web3 team was formed. [Cyber Nekos](http://pod.so/), [Legend of Fantasy War](http://legendfantasywar.com/), [Attrace](http://attrace.com/), [Tokenomy](http://tokenomy.com/) are our highlights.

<!-- column 05facbe7-847e-4290-abf7-eaed1b2fbb45 -->

* **Multiple study groups **within the team focusing on: Blockchain & Web3, Metaverse, AI & ML, Data Science, Automation.

We attract the same DNA. Our clients are organizations that put tech at great importance to their businesses. It's always a proud feeling when our clients share their achievements with us, knowing we play a part in it.

![[5658b14e0a88058716dd1b30f9cc3976_MD5.webp]]


### <span style='color:yellow'>Our vision and belief stays the same</span>

Even with everything we managed to pull through and achieve, we are still makers at heart. [Our vision and belief](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/) are built to stay.

[Engineering is still our culture](https://github.com/dwarvesf/playbook/blob/master/engineering/README.md). Software craftsmanship is still our end goal. We are still putting in hard work every day. It’s the spirit to build a company where everyone enjoys their work and stays proud of everything they ship.

# We are growing fast

### <span style='color:yellow'>Bigger & borderless team</span>

Remote working shaped into our culture. Our engineers have the full support they need to perform at their best. People were granted options to upgrade their WFH station. Everything is going smoothly as a 100% remote team across 4 different time zones. 

<span style='color:yellow'>**The Dwarves seek for more teammates in 2022**</span>. Our team is currently at 60 mems and we road for a double number. The list is opening at <span style='color:yellow'>**[Dwarves Career](/e55e8831f99f424d899b76c2a82fd21b)**</span>** **- but we will find you the best fit if we’re having the same core value. 
And we’d love to onboard like-minded people to our Discord Network: <span style='color:yellow'>**[discord.gg/dwarvesv](http://discord.gg/dwarvesv)**</span>.


### <span style='color:yellow'>Forming the getaway chalets</span>

<!-- column 8a88278d-79da-4913-9a82-4cf836cc6f81 -->

Though the Dwarves can work anywhere they want, we still have offices in 3 different cities in Vietnam.

* <span style='color:yellow'>**HCM**</span>: Our first official office, sitting in the heart of HCM
* <span style='color:yellow'>**Dalat**</span>: The built-in-office cafe intended for work-cations. Whenever our engineers feel like getting away from bustling cities, they can spend their days here. Our clients and partners are welcomed too.
* <span style='color:yellow'>**Hanoi**</span> (*coming very soon*): An office located in the tech district of the capital of Vietnam helps us be more available for more talents in the country.
