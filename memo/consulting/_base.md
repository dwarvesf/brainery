### Who we are

**Dwarves Consulting is team of individuals who possess a combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and strong communication abilities.**


### Our culture

- **Ahead of the market:** we continuously learn and discover about the market and technology so we can participate in new, cool challenges, strive for high-quality deliverables and maintaining high standards
- **Tech to solve problems:** first we understand the problems, we provide solutions before any hard coding
- **Network matters:** we welcome collaborations with everyone who has the same goals and believe as we do


### How we work

Our working environment is dynamic. Instead of pure knowledge / learning sessions, we try to learn and work together through real-life inquiries or requests from our potential clients. 

We also monitor the industry and report on what is being built, what is creating impact, and turn them into use-cases for practices and productions.  
  
We work in close collaboration with the [[memo/labs/_index|Labs Team]] and product team, to offer to specialized expertise to clients across various industries to ensure we apply our insights and learning to client projects.


### What we work forward to

We set out to become a team that can deliver the best client satisfaction possible, meaning continuously improve services. That involves taking care of the full project life cycle from providing client with the right solution, meeting their needs and constraints, to developing, delivering, transferring ownership.  
  
We want our team to be thinkers and problem-solvers, rather than just coding and doing handy works all the time, projects from projects. Then everyone get the fair reward and recognition in return. The more involved we get, the better the returns.


### How to become a member?

At the beginning, the team consists of members appointed by BoD and referral from Labs / Deliver team.  
  
We are looking for signals from members who are starting to show more involvement in their projects, can lead the team, has a knick for business aspects and getting good feedback from clients to invite to the team. Therefore, if consulting is the path for you, we invite you to actively contribute to tech discussions on our Discord server.
