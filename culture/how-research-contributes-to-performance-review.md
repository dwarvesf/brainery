Our organization values the research and development (R&D) efforts of our team members and aims to incorporate these contributions into performance reviews. It's important that individual R&D activities not only pursue personal growth but also align with our team and organizational objectives.

## Key Assessment Factors

For R&D activities, there are a few factors will contribute to your performance:

1. **Alignment with Team Objectives:** Your research should be aligned with topics identified as crucial for the future growth and success of our team.
2. **Relevance to Sales and Consulting Team:** The outcomes of your R&D activities should resonate with the interests and needs of our sales and consulting teams.
3. **Personal Topic Selection:** While topic selection is often a collective effort, we acknowledge that your preferred tech might not always be on the list. We understand that our choices may not always be perfect. If you have a topic you're passionate about and believe in its potential, we encourage you to pursue it. Please keep us informed about your progress and demonstrate the value of your chosen topic.

## Goal Setting and Review Process

Each research story will include R&D goals and objectives. These will be set by you with your team leader or supervisor and should be referenced in your self-review for the year-end performance evaluation process:

- **Goal Agreement**: At the beginning, clearly define your R&D goals in agreement with your team leader. This should include the topics of research and expected outcomes.
- **Flexibility in Topics**: While exploring new areas is encouraged, any changes in research topics must be promptly communicated and approved.
- **Timing of Assessment**: If you change your research topic late in the review period, the evaluation of your work will be deferred to the next review cycle. This ensures a fair and thorough assessment of your contributions.
