The concept of an "inner circle" within a company is not a new one, and at Dwarves, a software company founded by a group of engineers, this idea holds a significant value. Starting from scratch, the company has always placed emphasis on being surrounded by individuals who can efficiently ship software and don't waste time on unimportant tasks. These individuals are highly respected and valued within the company, as they play a crucial role in the development and success of projects.

It's not difficult to differentiate between those who can effectively contribute to the shipping process and those who cannot. Those who lack the ability to ship software efficiently are often viewed as a hindrance to the team and are not given the same level of respect and attention. This concept of valuing those who can effectively contribute to the development and shipping process is not exclusive to Dwarves, but is a structure found in many groups and organizations.

At Dwarves, there is also an inner circle of individuals who run the company and play a pivotal role during times of crisis. This inner circle is not formed through official invitations or set criteria, but rather through earning the respect and recognition of the group. Those who consistently demonstrate their value and ability to contribute to the development and success of the company are the ones who are recognized and included in this inner circle.

It is not about who one knows or what they have done in the past, but rather, it's about consistently showing that they matter and can make a significant impact on the company's success. This is the key to being a part of the inner circle at Dwarves.

The path to joining this inner circle follows a pattern of [building trust](trust.md) - starting with your immediate team, expanding to cross-team recognition, and eventually earning the confidence of company leadership through consistent excellence and reliability.

## What the inner circle actually does

Being part of the inner circle isn't just a status symbol. It comes with real responsibilities and expectations that extend beyond normal job duties.

**Crisis response**
When critical issues emerge, inner circle members are the first to be called. Whether it's a major system outage, a key client problem, or a strategic pivot, these are the people leadership trusts to assess the situation quickly and execute solutions under pressure.

**Strategic input**
Inner circle members influence company direction. They participate in planning discussions, provide technical perspectives on business decisions, and help shape the company's technical roadmap. Their opinions carry weight because they've proven their judgment over time.

**Culture stewardship**
These individuals help maintain and evolve company culture. They mentor new team members, set examples for professional behavior, and play key roles in hiring decisions. They're trusted to represent what Dwarves values in both their work and their interactions.

**Bridge building**
Inner circle members often serve as bridges between different parts of the organization. They translate between technical and business teams, help resolve conflicts, and ensure important information flows effectively throughout the company.

## The cost of membership

Inner circle status comes with trade-offs that not everyone wants to make.

**Higher expectations**
Your work is scrutinized more closely, and mistakes have bigger consequences. You're expected to perform consistently at a high level, even under pressure or during difficult periods.

**Increased responsibility**
You'll be asked to take on challenging assignments that others can't or won't handle. This often means longer hours, tougher problems, and more pressure to deliver results.

**Limited autonomy**
Paradoxically, being trusted more means having less freedom to choose your projects. The company directs your efforts toward its highest priorities, which may not always align with your personal interests.

**Always on call**
Inner circle members are expected to be available during crises, regardless of timing. Vacation plans might get interrupted, and weekends might include urgent problem-solving sessions.
