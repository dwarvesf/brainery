At Dwarves, *the core team live and breathe growth*. We believe that growth is our universal language, and we're always striving to improve ourselves, both personally and professionally. It's not just a job for us; it's a way of life. We're hustlers with an extra hat, always pushing ourselves to be better and earn more.

Every time we hire, we're looking for like-minded individuals who share our growth mindset. We want to be with people who are willing to challenge themselves and reach new heights.

Everything we do is centered around growth discussions and opportunity-seeking as a team. We don't believe in playing too much the work-life balance card; instead, we're always on the lookout for new opportunities to elevate.

### **70/50**

Our unspoken culture at Dwarves is called [70/50](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/blob/master/what-we-value.md#7050), and it's all about growth and opportunity. We don't live by a 9-5 schedule; we're committed to putting in an extra 20-50% effort to grow ourselves after our day job is done. It's not mandatory, but it's encouraged. The extra effort we put in increases our chances of reaching new heights, and it's rewarded when the things we build hit the market and bring value to our customers.

As a company that's purely based on technological know-how, we spend our free time on hobby projects or exploring new technologies. It's not just about building our skills; it's about developing our passion for growth.

> We believe that NOT all people can get along with these ideas, but who know if the like-minded will find this place home.

### Retaining people

We don't believe in retaining people by creating a non-challenging environment or looking back. We look to the future, always striving to be better and achieve more. When I sit down with managers from other companies, they often struggle with how to retain employees. But at Dwarves, we don't have that problem because we focus on growth, and that keeps us all around for the right reasons.

So, if you're looking for a place where growth is the norm, come join us at Dwarves. You'll be part of a team that's always hungry for more and committed to reaching new heights. We believe that growth is our universal language, and we can't wait to share it with you.
