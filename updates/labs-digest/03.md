## Notes from the catchup
weekly meeting #3 - 20/12/2023:

üß† **Rise on chatbot alternatives**
- @Tom Investigated a few chat UIs, like [LibreChat](https://docs.librechat.ai/) + [Ollama Web UI](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui) to help simplify testing and personal usage and reduce costs from subscribing to ChatGPT

üîç **Shared Query Processing through DuckDB WASM**
- @Tom demo'ed DuckDB over WASM to introduce use cases for infographics and real-time analytics
- @Tom's first demo uses DuckDB to process and convert data to readable arrays to pass to Observable Plot to plot the chart
	- ![](assets/labs-weekly-catchup-3-20231221150754783.webp)
- @Tom's second demo uses DuckDB inside Observable Notebooks to do real-time analytics inside the browser

ü•Ω **Bypassing reCaptcha using self-hosted AI model YoloV8**
- @Toan Demo'ed YoloV8 over Tensorflow.js, using WebGPU as the backend, to do object detection over recaptcha images

üèóÔ∏è **Building Desktop apps with Tauri**
- @Vy introduced Tauri, an app construction toolkit to help deploy frontend applications over multiple platforms
- @Vy Demo'ed a simple Tauri app with React + Tailwind and will open source soon
	- ![](assets/labs-weekly-catchup-3-20231221150359017.webp)
- He also mentioned an app called Spacedrive is desktop app built with Tauri
	- ![](assets/labs-weekly-catchup-3-20231221151543222.webp)
- (Vy) RSPC is also an interesting typesafe router to build APIs in Rust for React or TypeScript frontends to call on it

üí≠ **Thoughts and actions for next week**
- @An + @Vincent Will have an action + repository for passwordless next week
- @Hieu wants to apply GenState and a few other tools in Elixir to help with scalability, next week will have a demo to improve the alarm on NgheNhan
