Our first weekly catchup. We organize an agenda the day beforehand and consolidate our findings, notable research progress, possibly new tech, insight or technique everyone should know.

### Agenda:
Among the topics we will cover, there will be a short topic discussion and demonstration on AI Realtime memory knowledge updates by Tom. this will include:
- New approaches to memory consolidation  
- A small preview demo of what it looks like

### Output:
- Understand the research progress and passions of the labs team
- Understand any shortcomings or things to improve for the next weekly catchup

## Notes from the catchup
üß† **AI - Realtime Memory**

- LLMs are now using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context and updates.
- Realtime memory is another step into optimizing new data into an LLM's intuition through more unique base prompting.
- Challenges like token limits are being addressed with fewer steps and unique base prompting.

üïπÔ∏è **Rust Game Server on Actix**

- Significant progress on the Rust game server built on Actix.
- @khacvy also demoed a short multiplayer shooter game. üëæ 
- Exploring Tokio as an alternative framework to see cost benefits between it and Actix.
- Documentation gaps identified, considering better tooling for a smoother development experience.

üé® **Mochi UI Practices**

- Focus on standardization across Figma designs, component naming, and usability.
- Practices and our open-source standard are mostly finished, with us hosting a workshop at Thursday, December 14, 2023 400 PM.

üåê **WebStudio - Emerging Tech**

- WebStudio, an open-source low-code helper for building websites similar to WebFlow.
- Utilizes immerhin for large tree synchronization and real-time collaboration.

üåü **Potential Standards**

- JSON patches (RFC 6902) and design tokens (W3C standard) introduced by WebStudio.
- JSON patches for lightweight changes to JSON documents.
- Design tokens for consistent visual style in design systems.
