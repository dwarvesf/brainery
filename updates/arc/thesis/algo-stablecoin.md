> Algorithmic Stablecoins, with a $10B market cap in 2025, offer decentralized, scalable financial stability. Our methodology identifies high-impact offerings like governance apps and stabilization protocols, aligning with our verticals to deliver value with limited resources.

## Introduction

Algorithmic Stablecoins in 2025 are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain stable value through algorithms and economic incentives, without relying on fiat or crypto collateral. Despite setbacks like TerraUSD's (UST) $40B collapse in 2022, projects like Ampleforth and Frax have driven a recovery, with a $10B market cap. Their decentralized nature and DeFi integration make them a key trend. Using our market thesis methodology, we analyze Algorithmic Stablecoins' potential, identify high-impact opportunities, and plan actionable solutions for our software consulting firm, aligning with our verticals: team/individual productivity, community building, liquidity/fund engineering, and IP.

## Applying the market thesis methodology

Following our five-step methodology, we craft a thesis for Algorithmic Stablecoins, balancing data, intuition, and strategic alignment.

### 1. Understand the technology

#### Origin layer

Algorithmic Stablecoins emerged in 2018 with projects like Basis, seeking to overcome the centralization of fiat-backed stablecoins (e.g., USDT) and over-collateralization of crypto-backed ones (e.g., DAI). Ampleforth's rebase mechanism (2019) and TerraUSD's mint-burn model (2020) popularized the concept. UST's 2022 collapse exposed risks, but innovations like Frax's hybrid model revived interest. Funding for algorithmic stablecoin projects ($300M in 2024) and X posts about Frax's 99% peg stability signal momentum. Demand for decentralized finance, regulatory pressures on fiat-backed stablecoins, and DeFi's $200B TVL in 2025, as noted in your `forming-market-thesis.md`, drive relevance.

#### Core concept

Algorithmic Stablecoins maintain a stable value (e.g., ~$1) through algorithms that adjust supply or incentivize market actions (e.g., minting, burning), enabling decentralized, scalable financial transactions without asset backing.

#### Abilities

- **Decentralization**: Operates without centralized issuers, enhancing trustlessness.
- **Scalability**: Adjusts supply dynamically, supporting high transaction volumes.
- **Programmability**: Integrates with DeFi smart contracts for lending, trading.
- **Accessibility**: Open to anyone with a blockchain wallet.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces transaction costs (e.g., 0.1% vs. 3% for traditional payments).

#### What it's good at

- **Decentralization**: No reliance on issuers (e.g., 100% on-chain governance).
- **Scalability**: Dynamic supply supports growth (e.g., 10x volume spikes).
- **Cost efficiency**: Low fees on layer-2 (e.g., $0.10 vs. $10 on Ethereum).
- **DeFi integration**: Powers 20% of DeFi transactions (e.g., AMM pools).

#### What it's bad at

- **Peg stability**: Risks depegging (e.g., UST's 2022 crash lost 99% value).
- **Complexity**: Non-technical users struggle with rebase mechanisms.
- **Regulatory risk**: Faces scrutiny for lacking reserves (e.g., SEC probes).
- **Market confidence**: Post-UST, trust remains fragile.

#### Technical layer

- **Mechanisms**: Rebase (e.g., Ampleforth adjusts token supply daily to target $1) or mint-burn (e.g., Frax burns FXS to mint FRAX). Hybrid models use partial collateral (e.g., Frax's 80% USDC backing).
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Ethereum) or Rust (Solana) contracts execute supply adjustments. Frax's contract, for example, manages $2B in circulation.
- **Blockchains**: Ethereum (50% volume), Solana (~65,000 TPS), and Polygon (layer-2) host algorithmic stablecoins. Layer-2 reduces fees (e.g., $0.05 on Polygon).
- **Oracles**: Chainlink provides price feeds (e.g., FRAX/USD) for peg maintenance, but manipulation risks persist.
- **Governance Tokens**: Tokens like FXS (Frax) or AMPL (Ampleforth) incentivize stabilization and voting. ERC-20 standard dominates.
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: LayerZero enables stablecoin transfers across blockchains, but hacks (e.g., $320M Wormhole, 2022) pose risks.
- **Consensus**: Ethereum's Proof of Stake (~15 TPS) or Solana's high-throughput underpin transactions.

#### Hardest problems

- **Peg stability**: Ensuring consistent value during market volatility.
- **Security**: Protecting smart contracts from exploits ($1.5B lost in DeFi, 2022–2024).
- **Regulation**: Navigating AML/KYC compliance without reserves.
- **Scalability**: Overcoming blockchain throughput limits (e.g., Ethereum's 15 TPS).
- **User trust**: Rebuilding confidence post-UST collapse.

#### Limitations

- **Volatility risk**: Peg failures can cause catastrophic losses.
- **Complexity**: Rebase and mint-burn confuse non-technical users.
- **Adoption**: Limited to crypto-savvy users (~200M globally).
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Potential restrictions in key markets.

**Analysis**: Algorithmic Stablecoins' decentralization and scalability align with our liquidity and community verticals, but peg stability and trust issues require careful solution design.
