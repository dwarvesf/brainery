This folder is where we collect our raw thoughts on emerging tech trends. Everything here is LLM-generated following our [five-step market thesis methodology](/consulting/navigate/market-thesis-method).

## What you'll find here

These documents serve as our research workspace. We use them to:

- Spot early signals worth exploring
- Dig deep into emerging technologies
- Figure out who might actually use this stuff
- Connect tech capabilities to real problems
- Brainstorm solutions we could actually build

Think of it as our messy notebook before we write the clean version.

## How we do the work

Each thesis follows the same five-step process we've refined over the years:

1. **Spot the pulse** - Find early signals that something big might be coming
2. **Dig into the tech** - Understand what makes it tick and where it breaks  
3. **Find the right people** - Target folks aligned with our four verticals
4. **Match solutions to problems** - Connect what it can do with what people need
5. **Generate ideas and make plans** - Create stuff we can actually execute

We don't just guess. We balance hard data with experience to make smart bets.

## Current thesis collection

- [**Agentic AI**](agentic-ai.md) - Autonomous AI systems that execute tasks independently
- [**DeFi**](defi.md) - Blockchain-based financial ecosystem enabling peer-to-peer transactions
- [**DeFAI**](defai.md) - AI-enhanced DeFi combining LLMs with blockchain financial systems
- [**LLM**](llm.md) - Large Language Models enabling human-like text processing and automation
- [**Platform ops**](platform-ops.md) - Managing AI-driven platforms in fully automated environments
- [**Spatial computing**](spatial.md) - AR, VR, MR, and AI integration creating immersive digital-physical experiences
- [**Stablecoin**](stablecoin.md) - Cryptocurrencies designed for stable value enabling efficient transactions
- [**Algorithmic stablecoin**](algo-stablecoin.md) - Cryptocurrencies maintaining stable value through algorithms and economic incentives
- [**ZKP**](zkp.md) - Zero-Knowledge Proofs enabling privacy-preserving transactions and computations

## How it flows

```
Raw analysis (here) → Refinement → Final version (/arc)
```

We start messy, then get sharp. The best insights from these documents get polished and refined for our main [arc series](../README.md), where we share our final takes on the waves shaping software.

These aren't finished thoughts. They're starting points for deeper work. The promising stuff graduates to become the strategic bets that guide our direction.
