> Stablecoins, with a $180B market cap in 2025, enable stable, efficient financial transactions. Our methodology identifies high-impact offerings like stablecoin payment apps and cross-chain protocols, aligning with our verticals to deliver value with limited resources.

## Introduction

Stablecoins in 2025 are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets (e.g., USD, gold), offering low volatility for payments, savings, and DeFi applications. With a $180B market cap and growing use in cross-border payments and remittances, Stablecoins bridge traditional finance and blockchain. Using our market thesis methodology, we analyze Stablecoins' potential, identify high-impact opportunities, and plan actionable solutions for our software consulting firm, aligning with our verticals: team/individual productivity, community building, liquidity/fund engineering, and IP.

## Applying the market thesis methodology

Following our five-step methodology, we craft a thesis for Stablecoins, balancing data, intuition, and strategic alignment.

### 1. Understand the technology

#### Origin layer

Stablecoins emerged in 2014 with Tether (USDT), addressing cryptocurrency volatility (e.g., Bitcoin's 50% swings). MakerDAO's DAI (2017) introduced decentralized stablecoins, expanding DeFi use cases. Demand for low-cost remittances (e.g., $800B global market), distrust in centralized finance post-2008, and regulatory clarity (e.g., EU's MiCA, 2024) drove adoption. Funding for stablecoin projects ($700M in 2024) and X posts about USDC's payment use signal momentum. Stablecoins' role in DeFi (e.g., 60% of DeFi TVL) and cross-border trade, as noted in your `forming-market-thesis.md`, underscores their relevance.

#### Core concept

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain stable value, typically pegged to fiat (e.g., USD), commodities, or algorithms, enabling reliable transactions, savings, and DeFi integration without crypto's volatility.

#### Abilities

- **Stability**: Maintains near-constant value (e.g., USDC at ~$1).
- **Accessibility**: Open to anyone with a blockchain wallet.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces transaction costs (e.g., 0.1% vs. 3% for SWIFT).
- **Programmability**: Integrates with smart contracts for DeFi.
- **Interoperability**: Operates across blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).

#### What it's good at

- **Low volatility**: Stable value supports payments (e.g., 99.9% peg stability).
- **Cost efficiency**: Cuts fees for remittances (e.g., 70% cheaper than banks).
- **Global reach**: Serves unbanked populations (e.g., 1.4B globally).
- **DeFi integration**: Powers 60% of DeFi transactions (e.g., lending, trading).

#### What it's bad at

- **Centralization risks**: Fiat-backed stablecoins (e.g., USDT) rely on issuers, risking opacity.
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: Faces AML/KYC compliance demands (e.g., SEC audits).
- **Peg stability**: Algorithmic stablecoins (e.g., UST's 2022 collapse) can fail.
- **Scalability**: Limited by blockchain throughput (e.g., Ethereum's 15 TPS).

#### Technical layer

- **Types**: Fiat-backed (e.g., USDC, backed by USD reserves), crypto-backed (e.g., DAI, collateralized by ETH), and algorithmic (e.g., Ampleforth, supply-adjusted). Fiat-backed dominate with 80% market share.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Ethereum) or Rust (Solana) contracts manage issuance, redemption, and pegging. USDC's contract, for example, holds $35B in assets.
- **Blockchains**: Ethereum (60% stablecoin volume), Solana (~65,000 TPS), and Polygon (layer-2) host stablecoins. Layer-2 reduces fees (e.g., $0.10 vs. $10).
- **Oracles**: Chainlink provides price feeds for crypto-backed stablecoins (e.g., ETH/USD), ensuring accurate collateralization.
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: LayerZero and Wormhole enable stablecoin transfers across blockchains, but hacks (e.g., $320M Wormhole, 2022) pose risks.
- **Wallets**: MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet facilitate user interactions, managing private keys.
- **Consensus**: Ethereum's Proof of Stake (~15 TPS) or Solana's high-throughput underpin stablecoin transactions.

#### Hardest problems

- **Peg stability**: Maintaining 1:1 pegs, especially for algorithmic stablecoins.
- **Security**: Protecting reserves and smart contracts from hacks ($1B lost, 2022–2024).
- **Regulation**: Complying with global AML/KYC rules (e.g., EU's MiCA).
- **Scalability**: Overcoming blockchain throughput and fee limitations.
- **Trust**: Ensuring transparency for fiat-backed stablecoin reserves.

#### Limitations

- **Centralization**: Fiat-backed stablecoins rely on issuer trust (e.g., Tether's audits).
- **Cost**: High gas fees on Ethereum during congestion (e.g., $20/transaction).
- **Adoption**: Limited to crypto users (~200M globally).
- **Regulatory risk**: Potential bans or restrictions in key markets.

**Analysis**: Stablecoins' stability and efficiency align with our liquidity and community verticals, but centralization and regulatory risks require targeted solutions.
