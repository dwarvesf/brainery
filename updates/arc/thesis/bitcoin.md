> Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, and its ecosystem enable secure, low-cost transactions, transforming remittance, gaming, and e-commerce with trustless solutions. Dwarves can co-build infrastructure and application solutions with startups, like Lightning Network integrations and payment gateways, while internally optimizing financial workflows, with experiments targeting scalable payment and custody tools.

## Introduction

Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, and the ecosystem built around its blockchain, including Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, enable secure, transparent, and low-cost transactions without intermediaries. By 2025, Bitcoin and building with Bitcoin are poised to revolutionize startup innovation and Dwarves’ operations, offering robust infrastructure and applications for financial and non-financial use cases. Imagine a remittance startup using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for instant cross-border payments or Dwarves streamlining contractor payouts with a Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin’s trustless nature aligns with Dwarves’ mission to co-build with startups and enhance internal processes.

Market data underscores its growth: Bitcoin’s market capitalization reached $1.2 trillion in 2024, with over 500,000 daily transactions (CoinMarketCap). The Lightning Network processed $500 million in annual volume (Arcane Research). Venture funding for Bitcoin-focused startups hit $3 billion in 2024 (PitchBook). Bitcoin aligns with Dwarves’ verticals, team/individual productivity, community building, liquidity/fund engineering, and IP, by enabling efficient payments, tokenized incentives, financial transparency, and secure digital assets, while offering opportunities in external industries like remittance, gaming, and e-commerce.

For startups: Bitcoin empowers startups to create secure, low-cost financial services, from instant remittances to in-game economies, competing with centralized systems. A gaming startup, for example, could use Bitcoin for transparent in-game purchases, boosting player trust.

For Dwarves: Internally, Bitcoin can transform operations by enabling fast payments, transparent budgeting, and secure IP transactions, allowing the firm to operate with greater efficiency and decentralization.

## 1. Understand the technology

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by a proof-of-work blockchain, enabling secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries. Building with Bitcoin involves leveraging its blockchain, Layer-2 solutions (e.g., Lightning Network), and tools like wallets and APIs to create innovative applications, from payments to smart contracts.

**Origin layer**: Bitcoin was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as a response to centralized financial systems. The Lightning Network (2016) addressed scalability, enabling fast, low-cost transactions. Growing distrust in fiat systems, coupled with adoption by institutions and developers, drove Bitcoin’s growth. By 2024, advancements in Layer-2 solutions and developer tools like Taproot expanded use cases beyond currency.

**Technical layer**: Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, secured by miners. Smart contracts are enabled via Taproot and Layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network. Tools like Bitcoin Core manage nodes, while wallets (e.g., Electrum) and APIs (e.g., Blockstream) facilitate development. Oracles (e.g., Chainlink) bridge off-chain data for advanced applications.

- Key components:
  - Blockchain: Records transparent, immutable transactions.
  - Lightning Network: Enables fast, low-cost off-chain transactions.
  - Smart contracts: Support advanced logic via Taproot.
  - Wallets: Secure user access to Bitcoin funds.
  - APIs: Integrate Bitcoin with external systems.

**Core concept**: Bitcoin’s purpose is to provide a decentralized, secure digital currency and platform for trustless transactions, while building with Bitcoin enables innovative applications leveraging its blockchain’s security and infrastructure.

**Abilities**:

- Secure, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions.
