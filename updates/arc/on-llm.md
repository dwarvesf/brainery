There's a separate MOCs in `topics/` that you can take a look.
This page discuss the nature of this technology and area that it will impacts. Hence we point out the part where we can join in.

### Changes in human-machine interaction

Now to control the machine, you don't have to be programmer, to learn programming language to talk to it. The abstraction layer goes up one more level. Natural language is a great interface that everyone can use.

The core technique is the data vector embedding. Instead of comparing by exact matching bits by bits, now we compare vectors of multiple dimensions in their latent space. Going up one level in abstraction requires more computing power, but will bring more joy to the mass.

### Changes in software making

It brings better code completion. Back then if we can only complete phrase or sentence, now it can help to autocomplete a whole block of code, an entire file, a feature or even a codebase; based on the given input.

Now as software programmer, you can talk to the computer more efficient.

Data wise

### Changes in businesses

Information completion is reaching a huge new level, where patterns can be extracted. If you look at it as a software, then a prompt you input into it is like a query into that latent space. It will vomit the closet vector that it knows.

With help from LLM and another abstraction level, now almost everything can be control thru the natural language interface. AI model with reasoning ability can help us to make decision at certain level.

Productivity spike up. Let's say of 95% works that we cannot automate before because of the pattern haven't been encoded in the database, now it can be presented as vectors.

### Changes in org structure

Back then we build large scale company because we need people to stay in their position/role to do their job. Mostly input data, make changes, draft response and report. Now they can be handled by agents thanks to the help from LLM.

Now to keep the same size, the org has to move up to become a megacorp, to handle more works.
Or they can just resize the org, and offload the repetitive work to agents.

There will be more micro-company, solopreneur. Corps have to upscale to become megacorp.

### Changes in learning

Like [martial art and gun](), LLM can gain new knowledge, think and make decision at certain level. Getting better everyday. It makes us want to lean on them, dulls our intuition and problem-solving, weaken human connections.

This challenge require an ability to find a right guidance in learning and practicing to make it our collab tool, instead of our replacement.

### The opportunities

As everyone will want to have their agents, work and personal

- We can help companies to design and deploy their agents.
- We can build free or premium agents for personal use.

For creator tooling, we can contribute in system that power:

- model
- prompt
- agent
- ide
- platform ops

For founders, it will be fast to build prototype and validate new idea. Small team can now use agents to compete with corps.

AI team can compete with each other by having a better agents. Or can compete on providing better experience for the user.

### To prepare

- Know how to write prompt.
- Know how to architect and build agentic-driven system.
- Know how to dispatch message, resources between agents and systems.
- Toolset to create, test and run prompts.
- Toolset to create, test and run models.
- Toolset to create, test and run agents.
