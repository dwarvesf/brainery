Technology moves in waves. Each breakthrough brings new possibilities, reshapes how we build software, and forces us to evolve our craft. We call these pivotal moments **arcs** because they represent complete cycles of innovation that fundamentally change our direction.

## Why we document our arcs

The tech landscape shifts constantly. What seemed revolutionary five years ago might be table stakes today. By documenting our perspective on each major wave, we create a living record of how our thinking evolves and why we make the choices we do.

Think of these arcs as our collective memory and compass. They help us:

- **Make sense of the noise:** Not every shiny new technology deserves our attention. We filter signal from noise and explain what actually matters.
- **Share our reasoning:** When we adopt new tools or approaches, these documents explain our thought process and the context behind our decisions.
- **Learn from our journey:** Looking back at previous arcs helps us recognize patterns and avoid repeating mistakes.
- **Guide our future:** Understanding where we've been helps us navigate where we're going.

## How arcs work

Each arc explores a specific technology wave that has meaningfully impacted how we work. We don't just explain what the technology does, we dig into why it matters, how it changes the game, and what it means for crafting better software.

The **final.md** file captures our long-term perspective, the overarching themes that connect all these waves into a coherent vision of where software craftsmanship is heading.

## Current arcs

We're documenting our takes on these major waves:

- [Blockchain](on-blockchain.md): Decentralized systems and the infrastructure they demand
- [DeFi](on-defi.md): Financial primitives rebuilt from the ground up  
- [LLM](on-llm.md): Large language models reshaping how we interact with code
- [Agent](on-agent.md): Autonomous systems that extend human capability
- [Platform](on-platform-ops.md): The evolution of how we build and deploy software

Each arc represents years of experimentation, learning, and real-world application. They're not academic exercises, they're battle-tested insights from building software in rapidly changing landscapes.
