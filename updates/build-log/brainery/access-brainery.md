We want you to easily tap into the collective knowledge and AI power of **Brainery**. The main way to do this is through our **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

Think of **MCP** as the universal key to unlock Brainery’s data and its smart Large Language Model (LLM) features. It’s the standard way we ensure different tools and services can talk to Brainery smoothly and reliably, as we detailed in the [Brainery architecture](architecture.md).

**What this means for you as a developer:**

Good news! You don’t need to wrestle with a whole new set of complex APIs for everyday access. We’ve focused on making integration simple. You can bring Brainery’s power into your go-to tools, scripts, or development environments by just adding an **MCP configuration**.

Once configured, you can:

* Query for specific data points or insights.
* Ask the LLM to process or summarize information.
* Fetch connected ideas and trends directly within your workflow.

Essentially, adding the **MCP config** to your environment lets you make **Brainery** a natural extension of how you already work. We believe this approach makes accessing our second brain both powerful and practical for your daily tasks.
