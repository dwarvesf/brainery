### TL;DR

LLMs are reshaping how we interact with tech, build software, run businesses, and learn. We can help clients design AI agents, build creator tools, and use LLMs as a collaborative tool, not a replacement.

### Why LLMs matter for us

LLMs are a game-changer, and as a consulting team, we need to understand their impact to stay ahead. Building on our growth engine, where we spot trends like AI advancements, and our market thesis, where we bet on tech like LLMs, this guide explores how they’re shifting the tech landscape. By diving in, we can offer consulting services that help clients leverage LLMs, keeping us at the forefront of this wave.

### Changes in human-machine interaction

LLMs make talking to machines easier than ever. You don’t need to be a programmer or learn a coding language anymore. Now, natural language is the interface, something everyone can use. For example, a client can say, “Build me a chatbot,” and an LLM can help us draft the code in minutes.

This works because of data vector embedding. Instead of matching exact words, LLMs compare ideas in a multi-dimensional space (called latent space) to understand meaning. It takes more computing power, but it opens up tech to more people, which is a big win for accessibility.

### Changes in software making

LLMs are speeding up how we build software. Before, code completion tools could only suggest a line or two. Now, LLMs can autocomplete entire blocks, files, or even features based on what you ask for. For instance, on a recent project, we used an LLM to draft a user authentication system in hours instead of days, letting us focus on fine-tuning.

From a data perspective, LLMs store knowledge as vectors, not rigid databases. This means they can pull patterns from messy, unstructured data, like customer feedback or project notes, helping us spot trends faster and build better software.

### Changes in businesses

LLMs are taking business productivity to new levels. They can extract patterns from huge amounts of data, almost like querying a database with a prompt. For example, a client might ask, “What do my customers think about my product?” An LLM can analyze reviews and give a detailed summary, saving weeks of manual work.

With LLMs, almost anything can be controlled through natural language. AI agents with reasoning skills can even make decisions, like scheduling meetings or drafting reports. This means we can automate tasks that were too complex before, boosting efficiency by a huge margin.

### Changes in org structure

LLMs are changing how companies are built. In the past, we needed big teams to handle repetitive tasks like data entry or report drafting. Now, AI agents can take over those jobs. For example, a marketing team might use an agent to write social media posts, freeing up staff for creative work.

This shift creates two paths. Big companies can grow into megacorps, handling more work with fewer people. Or, they can downsize and let agents handle the repetitive stuff. At the same time, LLMs make it easier for small teams, like micro-companies or solopreneurs, to compete with larger firms by automating key tasks.

### Changes in learning

LLMs can learn, think, and make decisions at a basic level, and they’re getting better every day. This is great, but it comes with a challenge. Relying too much on them can dull our problem-solving skills and weaken human connections. For instance, if we always ask an LLM for answers, we might stop thinking critically ourselves.

The trick is to use LLMs as a collaborative tool, not a replacement. We can lean on them for quick insights, like summarizing a tech article, but still practice our own problem-solving to keep our skills sharp. It’s about finding the right balance.

### Opportunities for our consulting team

LLMs open up exciting ways for us to help clients and grow our expertise. Here’s where we can step in:

- **Design and deploy AI agents.** Companies want custom agents for work tasks, like customer support bots, and we can help build them.  
- **Create personal agents.** We can build free or premium agents for individuals, like a personal assistant that schedules your day.  
- **Build creator tools.** We can contribute to systems that power LLMs, like models, prompts, agents, IDEs, or platform ops tools.  
- **Support founders.** Small teams can use LLMs to prototype fast, and we can help them validate ideas and compete with bigger firms.  
- **Compete on experience.** AI teams will race to build better agents, but we can stand out by offering the best user experience, like seamless agent integration.  

This ties into our work in test the water, where we validate new services, and gives us a chance to lead in this space.

### How to prepare

To make the most of LLMs, we need to build the right skills and tools. Here’s what to focus on:

- Learn to write clear prompts to get the best results from LLMs.  
- Understand how to design and build agent-driven systems, like a chatbot network.  
- Know how to manage messages and resources between agents and systems.  
- Build tools to create, test, and run prompts, models, and agents.  

For example, we might develop a tool to test LLM prompts for a client project, ensuring the agent responds accurately. This keeps us ready to offer top-notch consulting services as LLMs grow.
