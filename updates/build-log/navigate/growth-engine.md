### so, how to address new market

when the market is here, it might be too late for the consulting team, as it takes time to catch up, learn and build advantages.

so we need a way to detect if there's any upcoming market will arrive.

and to do that, we leverage our growth engine. part of it is the social listening module.

the social listening keeps retrieve data from multiple sources, including, hiring, funding, tech news etc. and the team interests to develop the tech radar.

we layer information in levels that help us to indicate which tech is growing or more adoption.

things like hackathon, or new fund raise at different rounds, or new pulse from the KOLs also counts.
