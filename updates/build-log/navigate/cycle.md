innovation goes with [[the-adjacent-possible]]

![[adjacent-possible.png]]

like golang is a new improvement from language development & cloud computing
like blockchain is a new improvement from network & decentralization
like LLM is a new wave improvement from AI
spacial computing is a mix of new hardware interface

### cycle

technology breakthru run in cycle

![[innovation-adoption.png]]

cycle starts and cycle ends

funding come and go
funding come when there's huge potential about the tech
funding leave when there's no more potential (game to play or thing to build) in that tech

so is the market demand, it goes up and down accordingly

at the same time, there's thousand of tiny pulse hoat dong
there's always old tech that people are still cooking on it
there's brand new tech that people want to innovate.

### to not be surprised

a/ know the market will shift
to not get surprised is to know and get prepared when market shift, one is to know the indication.
when market shift, there will be less news or noise about the things that you already know.

b/ aware that market is shifting
this is the important phase, there's not too much news, there's no mainstream media, but mostly from rare tech ppl to ask user to use something they build, there's reddit thread or might be via X, or github discussion. but no media.

and this is where we have time to prepare the team, gain knowledge, do experiments, on and on.
and to that, we use tools and analyze data to learn and make decision.

c/
know that market is already shifted
when the market is here, it might be too late for the consulting team, as it takes time to catch up, learn and build advantages.

- social and mainstream are flooding with news, KOLs open courses to teach people the new things
- consumers will start posting review, discuss tips & tricks
- team don't feel like not interested & relevant to the new narratives
- team might not be able to build the next type of software
- team size might shrink as the result of the irrelevant in the divergence, as ref to the team cycle
