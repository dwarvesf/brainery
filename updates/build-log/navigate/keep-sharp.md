Qs
- how to maintain the technology edge/tech know-how for the team?
- how to keep team's delivery quality?

after getting signals

1/
indicate what make the edge in this wave
like setting the goal, map it back to nature of the consulting model
is it tech know-how?
will it boost productivity?
what impact will it bring?

2/
participate
the goal is to gain experience, get use-cases
- buidl with other via oss
- or buidl your experiment
- to join hackathon
- you can even do it free or low cost as in the team can low-down the risk, save time, and earn rep.

3/
maintain the team edge
reflex from experiments, builds to come up with insight, tool and workflow
personal elevation is tough
team elevation is harder, but it's possible via training and shadowing

### shadowing

one of my lesson learned, is don't spend too much time and have high expectation in training, that it will help your team grow. sure ppl will get populated with new knowledge, but you can't force them to learn, or it come with very high cost.

the technique that we should apply is to pair a newbie with someone who has experience in the new tech.
shadowing is another form of pairing. make sure the team will spread knowledge via hands-on environment.
