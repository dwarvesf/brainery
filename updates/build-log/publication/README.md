This documentation series details how we transform raw outputs from our engineering efforts, like meeting notes, Discord chats, and tech logs, into polished content across various formats and channels, building a bridge between our daily work and our community.

### Publication formats and channels

We share our content in multiple formats to reach our community wherever they are. Here's a look at the formats we use, the channels where we publish them, their purpose, and the audience traits for each platform.

| **Format**   | **Channels** | **Purpose** | **Audience** |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Reel         | YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels, TikTok | Quick updates/insights. | Tech-interested, younger audience seeking quick, visual content. |
| Video        | YouTube                          | In-depth explorations. | Tech/educational audience seeking detailed content (5-15 mins). |
| Article      | Memo, LinkedIn, Medium           | Detailed findings/stories. | Memo: Internal team. LinkedIn/Medium: Tech professionals, readers interested in thought leadership and trends. |
| Newsletter   | Email                            | Monthly summaries. | Subscribed community, professionals seeking curated tech updates. |
| Podcast      | Apple Podcasts, Spotify          | Deep dive discussions. | Tech professionals/enthusiasts, listeners seeking audio insights (20-60 mins). |

### Our approach to publication

To make the most of these channels, we tailor our content to fit each platform's audience. Reels on TikTok are short and trendy, while LinkedIn articles dive deep with professional insights. We publish regularly, scheduling reels 3-5 times a week, podcasts biweekly, and newsletters monthly, using tools to keep things consistent. We encourage engagement with clear calls to action, like inviting feedback on Discord or prompting comments on YouTube. To measure success, we track views, shares, and downloads, adjusting our strategy to better connect with our community.
