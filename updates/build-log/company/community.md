Building a company is hard. Building a [community](/handbook/community) around your company? That's how you create something truly sustainable. A strong community becomes your most powerful moat, your best marketing channel, and your source of continuous innovation. It's the difference between having customers and having advocates.

For research-first companies, community isn't just nice to have, it's strategic necessity. But here's what many miss: community is also your primary inbound channel and [testing ground](/consulting/navigate/test-the-water). When we need to validate a new consulting service for emerging tech like AI or blockchain, our community becomes the first place we test the water. Real feedback from real developers beats any market research.

We operate our [Discord](/handbook/community/discord) as both company space and developer community, staying as open as possible. This transparency builds trust and attracts the right people. Our community members see how we work, what we're excited about, and where we're heading. They become early clients, referral sources, and talent pipeline all at once.

## Start where people already gather

Don't try to build community in a vacuum. Find where your target audience already hangs out and add value there first. Industry forums, professional networks, existing events. Show up consistently, share insights generously, and help others solve problems. Community building starts with being a good community member yourself.

**Events** create the deepest connections. Whether you host meetups, speak at conferences, or organize workshops, face-to-face interactions build trust faster than anything online. Start small: monthly breakfast sessions with local professionals, or quarterly deep-dives into emerging trends. The key is consistency and value, not scale.

**Online forums** scale your reach and capture ongoing conversations. For us, Discord works perfectly because developers already live there. We've structured it with both open channels for community discussion and internal spaces for our team. This blend lets people see our expertise in action while building genuine relationships.

## Testing ground for new ideas

Your community becomes your laboratory. When we spot an emerging technology worth exploring, we don't immediately build a full consulting offering. Instead, we share insights in our community channels, gauge interest, and see who engages. Those first conversations often lead to pilot projects with community members who become our front-beach clients.

This approach cuts validation time from months to weeks. Community members give honest feedback because they're invested in our success. They tell us if an idea is worth pursuing or if we're missing something important. It's lean startup methodology with a built-in focus group.

## Nurturing growth

Great communities are like gardens: they need consistent tending. Share interesting finds, celebrate member achievements, connect people who should know each other. Your role shifts from expert to curator, from speaker to facilitator.

The best part? A thriving community becomes self-sustaining. Members bring in other members. Discussions generate new ideas for your research. Projects emerge that benefit everyone. What started as a business strategy becomes a genuine ecosystem of mutual support.

Start with one platform, one regular touchpoint, one way to bring people together around shared interests. Community builds momentum slowly, then suddenly.
