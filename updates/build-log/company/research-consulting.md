Here's the thing about staying ahead in tech: you can't just follow trends. You need to see what's coming before everyone else does. That's where a strong research team becomes your secret weapon. They're the ones digging into emerging technologies, experimenting with new tools, and spotting opportunities while others are still catching up. But here's the kicker: they don't just research for the sake of it. They feed those insights directly to your consulting team, opening doors to new projects and giving you solutions that competitors can't offer.

Think of it like this: your research team is the radar, scanning the horizon for what's next. Your consulting team is the crew that takes those signals and turns them into real value for clients. When they work together, magic happens. Clients don't just get advice; they get cutting-edge strategies built on fresh insights. You're not just solving today's problems; you're preparing them for tomorrow's opportunities.

## Finding the right people

So what makes someone great for this setup? Look for curious minds who can wear multiple hats. You want people who get excited about new tech but can also explain it to a business owner without making their eyes glaze over. They should be comfortable saying "I don't know, but let me find out" and then actually do the digging.

But here's what really matters: **learning and sharing skills**. These folks need to be learning machines who can absorb new concepts fast, then turn around and teach others. The best research team members are those who naturally share what they discover, whether through quick demos, written insights, or casual conversations. If they hoard knowledge, you lose the competitive edge.

Start small: two or three people who can research deep and consult smart. Give them space to experiment, fail, and share what they learn. The payoff? You'll build a reputation as the team that's always one step ahead, and clients will come to you for solutions others can't even see yet.

This isn't just about hiring smart people. It's about creating a culture where staying relevant becomes everyone's job, and staying ahead becomes your company's default mode.
