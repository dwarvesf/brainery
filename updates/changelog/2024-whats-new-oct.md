## Labs OGIF office hour - Building core knowledge
We’re making knowledge-sharing worth it. AI/LLM contributions this month scored 3x-4x rewards, as a big thanks to everyone bringing in their insights.

## Navigating market shifts
We’re re-centering our focus to meet the moment. AI, blockchain, data - this is where we’re investing our time and talent, as we keep pace with client needs and market demands.

1. **Consulting Shift**: As client requirements change, so do our team’s. We’re doubling down on core contributors who are active, adaptable, and ready to take on high-impact projects. Others may need to pause or refocus to keep pace with where we’re going.
2. **Lab Team**: The Lab remains the heartbeat of our innovation. Expectations (and rewards) are higher for those pushing the boundaries, writing, exploring, and applying new ideas.
3. **Community Backbone**: Nine years in, our Discord stays strong - a space for learning, sharing, and connecting, whether you’re new, tenured, or an alumni. 

## Weekly commentary - Product design & AI digest
Rolling out two new series this month: a Product Design Weekly and an AI Digest. It’s insight meets action, with practical takes on where product design and AI are headed.

- **Product Design Weekly:** A no-nonsense look at what’s actually working in design. Real-world insights, practical UI/UX tips, and everything you need to create experiences that stick.
- **AI Digest:** Your weekly dose of AI, minus the hype. From useful tools to practical insights, it’s what you need to know to stay smart about where AI is headed.

### Throwback to Vietnamese Women’s day
We took a moment to celebrate to celebrate the women at Dwarves. We marked the occasion with a round of gifts and a cozy team dinner - just a simple way to say thanks to the incredible women who shape our team and bring heart to our work every day.
