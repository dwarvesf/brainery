In the past six months, we've made some pretty impressive strides in testing new standards and adding more automation, activities, and rewards to our Discord server to foster a supportive community among tech lovers.

Take a moment to reflect on our journey so far, and let's get excited about what we'll accomplish together before the year ends.

## Community Growth
### Organized offline meet-up
Our Year-End Party (YEP) was the first offline meet-up that set the tone for future gatherings,  where peeps can connect in person with like-minded people. Building on its success, we hosted our second Ho Chi Minh City meetup on May 31st.

Over 50 enthusiastic members joined us for a night of tech talks, and all-around good vibes. It was an opportunity to connect with our community in person and share our passion for technology.

### Dwarves community is growing with more contributions
A big thanks to our active members who have taken part in learning and sharing knowledge with our peeps. 

Long Bui Van (@longddl) has published helpful notes on data pipelines and learning vector databases. You can explore at:

- [Data Pipeline Design Framework](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/engineering/data/data-pipeline-design-framework/)
- [Quick Learning Vector Database](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/engineering/data/quick-learning-vector-database/)

@jack collaborated with @phucld on [How to bridge $DFG from Ethereum Mainnet to Base Network for staking.](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/how-to-transfer-dfg-from-eth-to-base-for-staking/)

Additionally, several other members have made noteworthy contributions from @tom, @hnh, @vincent, @bienvh, @innno_, @nikki, @huytq, @minhlq, @nhuthm, @hieuthu1, @antran, @ngocthanh, @thanh, @minh_cloud, @minh, @truongquoctuan, @tristran, @anna, @nambui, @tay, @datpv, @datnguyennnx, @nam, @taipn, @hoangnnh, @lapnn, @hieuthu2, @huymaius, @phucld for keeping our server active and full of great content.

## Team Growth
### Building Dwarvesâ€™ wiki - memo.d.foundation
[memo.d.foundation](http://memo.d.foundation/) is where we share how we work, learn, and operate as a team. This site is part of our continuous learning engine, aiming to build a 1% improvement habit by learning in public.

There's a long road ahead to make it the ultimate knowledge source for the team, as a research-focused firm. We aim for the memo to be a centralized knowledge hub that uses a markdown format, displays a graph view, and connects through topic nodes.

Through learning, sharing, applying, and elevating our core knowledge, we can grow as a team and ship software more efficiently.

You will get a 5-15 ICY reward for each publication. Community members are welcome to share their learning notes too.

### Upgrading ICY reward for Dwarves learning system
We're excited about the future of ICY and our plans rolled out since its launch in September 2022:

- Monthly reward system for learning contribution up to 3000 ICY.
- ICY contract moved to Base chain for NFT/staking.
- New members joining our Discord with a verified account will get 0.1 ICY.
- Share links in **ðŸ’»ãƒ»tech, ðŸ’¡ãƒ»til** earn 1 ICY.
- Share your expertise in OGIF talks and earn 15-25 ICY per talk.
- Rewarding our top contributors weekly on Friday receives 3 ICY.
- Link Mochi wallet to GitHub for ICY rewards
- Earn & Stake ICY for rewards and future benefits.

### Improvement in internal tooling: Fortress, Tono, Mochi
Weâ€™ve made several upgrades to enhance our Discord server with our self-built bots, improving task management and overall server experience.

**Tono:** Server management bot that keeps the network running smoothly, tracks weekly activities, and generates top contributor and top reading lists both daily and weekly.

**Fortress:** Tracks performance and issue reporting, offering real-time memo updates and weekly memo publication reports.

**Mochi:** Tip bot for sending virtual kudos to show appreciation for others.

### Research topics: the road to expand the knowledge base
Solving problems using the latest technologies has always been our goal. This year's research focus is based on five key pillars:

- **Tooling:** Devbox, Colima, alert/monitoring standards
- **Software Architecture:** Event-driven architecture, Modular Monolith
- **LLM:** RAG, MLOps
- **Blockchain:** Solana infrastructure, Monolithic vs. Modular blockchain
- **Coding Security:** Standard security procedures, Zero trust infrastructure, GitOps

We've made progress in building internal tools like Tono Bot and Memo using LLM/RAG. Additionally, we've introduced our [Cyber Security Framework](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/security/how-i-came-up-with-our-security-standard/) and adopted & built a Map of Content for [Devbox](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/devbox-local-development-env/).

### Tech research advancements in tooling, architecture, & LLM
We closely monitor tech trends every month to identify those with high potential that could become part of our growing tech stack. 

In the past six months, our radar has detected:

- AI/LLM dominating the market. We've seen advanced models like GPT-4o and Sora, and open-source models like Llama 3 and Mistra, [providing new opportunities](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/market-report-may-2024#gpt-4o-opportunities-and-disruptions) for richer applications and automation tools.
- RAG remains the top architecture for applications with LLM models. The [next advancements](https://www.notion.so/State-of-Dwarves-2024-Semi-annual-Review-7915e90978c14739be0ad7e66a377718?pvs=21) will refine retrieval processes to manage the growing online information, including multimodal data integration.
- Rust is the top choice for developing tooling and system-level software due to its performance. Big names like [Google and Microsoft advocate for Rust](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/market-report-mar-2024/#other-notable-trends) to address [memory safety vulnerabilities](https://www.notion.so/State-of-Dwarves-2024-Semi-annual-Review-7915e90978c14739be0ad7e66a377718?pvs=21).
- Edge computing and serverless architecture are the [new wave in modern web development](https://www.notion.so/State-of-Dwarves-2024-Semi-annual-Review-7915e90978c14739be0ad7e66a377718?pvs=21). Platforms like Cloudflare and Fly.io are simplifying complexity for developers. Building web applications with edge computing speeds up page load times and reduces server maintenance costs.

### Resume OGIF - Dwarves' weekly Friday sharing
OGIF is our weekly Friday tradition where members share 10-minute talks. After three months we have discussed diverse topics like software development, industry trends, finance, entrepreneurship, blockchain, AI, and more. It's a quick, engaging way to learn something new.

In this era of public learning, weâ€™re excited to see what the team will create. You can revisit our OGIF sharing [here](https://memo.d.foundation/updates/ogif/11-ogif-office-hours-0621/).
