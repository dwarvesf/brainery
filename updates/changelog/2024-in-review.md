Closing another milestone with 2024, it has been a year of building and rebuilding — strengthening what works, fixing what doesn’t, and uncovering new paths along the way. Every milestone reached this year carries the marks of teamwork and persistence.

Market shifts opened new territories, while our core in sharing knowledge and AI grew stronger. We turned AI from experiments into daily tools, grew our lab team into a real force for innovation, and watched 37 OGIF sessions turn into solutions everyone uses. Knowledge sharing became part of our DNA, with 335 memo entries proving that good ideas need to be shared.

Starting with a handful of tech enthusiasts, our community now spans across different domain. For a tech team like Dwarves, there are only a few things that matter. Let’s reflect and reinforce what matters to us.

# Team growth
## memo.d.foundation: Capturing a year of collective knowledge with 335 entries
[memo.d.foundation](https://memo.d.foundation/) started as a company wiki and grew into a central hub for documenting what we learn as a team and community. From tech know-how to operational know-how, it's all here. **With 335 entries published this year**, it shows how knowledge sharing has become part of our DNA.

The focus on Mastery, Meaning, and Autonomy (MMA) drove real growth in our knowledge base. You can see it in the increased contributions, covering everything from practical work solutions to foundational concepts. 

Highlights:

- Streamlined memo submissions with quick commands like `?memo pr` and `?memo list`.
- Real-time PR notifications in Discord for easier collaboration.

## OGIF: When learning and sharing became part of our DNA
Every Friday at 5PM, we gather on Discord to share what we've learned. **37 sessions** this year, each adding something useful to how we think and work.

The idea stays simple: take 10 minutes to teach everyone learn something new. From coding patterns to market shifts, if it helps, it belongs here. We've covered everything from Go weekly, system design, AI/LLM, blockchain to product design and tech signal reports.

OGIF showed us who digs deep into problems, who explains clearly, who brings different angles. These talks helped form our labs’ team naturally.

## ICY in 2024: A reward system knowledge powers team growth
Launched in September 2022, ICY was used to reward for all members for engaging in discussions, research on Dwarves’ tech, and more.

This year, a monthly pool of 2500 ICY (~$4000) sparked more learning than we anticipated. When AI and LLM insights took center stage, we tripled the rewards to keep good ideas flowing.

**6,660 ICY (~$9k)** distributed highlighted our commitment to learning together, with 70% of rewards going to AI/LLM, Golang, Software Architecture, and Blockchain. Made sense, given how fast this space moves. Check it out at [🧊・earn-icy](https://discord.com/channels/462663954813157376/1006198672486309908/1239502938918096960).

**Key contributors:**

- **OGIF Talks:** @fuatto, @datnguyennnx, @monotykamary, @hoangnnh, @lapnn, @nambui.
- **Memo Notes:** @thanh, @hoangnnh, @datnguyennnx, @fuatto.
- **Bounties:** @bienvh, @innno, @minhcloud, @quang.
- **Tech sharing:** @monotykamary, @phucld, @minhlq, @antran, @huymaius, @datnguyenxx.

ICY enhancements included moving contracts to Base chain, GitHub account linking, and laying the groundwork for NFT and staking opportunities. Even guests now earn ICY - a warm welcome and simple way to reward collaboration.

## Team copilots: AI tools that made workflows faster
We didn’t just build tools; we shared them. The team copilots index became a collection of practical solutions, built by us, for us, and ready for the team to use. 

**Why it mattered:**

- Tools solving real problems, tested and proven by teammates.
- A hub for sparking ideas to build your own copilots.
- AI helpers simplifying and speeding up daily tasks.

You can explore the full list of copilots [here](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ai/copilots/team-copilots).

The focus was never on complexity but on simplicity and utility. Every tool was built with a clear purpose: to help the team do better work with less friction.

## Weekly Commentary: Turning trends, insights into actionable items
As a research-focused team, collecting and sharing knowledge became part of our speed. We saw it in our velocity - shipping got smoother when everyone knew more. 

This year, our weekly updates grew from Go-weekly insights into a broader lens on what we’re building and learning as a team. 

**Commentary series expanded into four practical domains**

- **Go weekly** grew with @fuatto's Enterprise MOC, showing how we're using Golang for real business challenges.
- **AI Digest** delivered clear, tool-focused updates for applying AI effectively.
- **Product Design Weekly** offered actionable UI/UX tips that go beyond surface-level advice.
- **Consulting Snapshot** highlighted key tech and business trends that matter.

Weekly OGIF sessions and memo notes kept the insights flowing. Each series aims for the same thing: useful knowledge you can put to work.

### Refining service packages for what clients actually need
We’re re-centering our focus to meet the moment. AI, blockchain, data - this is where we’re investing our time and talent, as we keep pace with client needs and market demands.

1. **Consulting shift**: As client requirements change, so do our team’s. We’re doubling down on adaptable, high-impact contributors while others may pause or refocus to match our direction.
2. **Lab team**: The Lab remains the heartbeat of our innovation. Expectations (and rewards) are higher for those pushing the boundaries, writing, exploring, and applying new ideas.
3. **Community backbone**: Nine years in, our Discord stays strong - a space for learning, sharing, and connecting, whether you’re new, tenured, or alumni.

Simplifying where it counts, we’ve delivered faster solutions and brought clarity to every project.

## Vietnam tech ecosystem
### Building a network of trusted partners in Vietnam’s tech ecosystem
Vietnam’s tech market is vibrant and growing, attracting startups and investors. Following the forecast, Vietnam’s digital economy is projected to reach $43 billion by 2025, fueled by breakthroughs in AI, fintech, and crypto - areas we’re eager to shape alongside nearly 100 active investors.

Leading firms like 500 Startups Vietnam, VSV Capital, and VinaCapital Ventures are driving this progress, supporting innovative startups and the broader ecosystem. By connecting key players in the ecosystem, this report aims to establish a network of trusted partners who can collaborate and drive mutual growth.

# Community growth
Being part of the tech community means stepping up, sharing what you’ve learned, and helping others grow. At Dwarves network, contributing back is woven into everything we do.

Haven’t properly highlighted this yet, but 2024 brought some real bright spots in how we learn together. 37 OGIF sessions, 335 memo entries and a monthly pool of 2500 ICY for learning might just sound like numbers, but each one proved why sharing knowledge makes a difference.

## A community driven by learning and sharing culture
Through **memo** and **OGIF**, it doesn’t just sit on a shelf, they’re put to work by anyone who needs them. The monthly rewards made sharing worth everyone's time. Discord saw more tech discussion, memo tackled harder problems, and OGIF sessions dug deeper into tech that mattered. Anyone can earn ICY by participating in community activities.

## Engaging with the community: Showing up and sharing back
The tech community is active right now, and we’re right in the mix. We’re diving headfirst into events, meetups, and summits to connect with the tech community. That gives us a clearer sense of where we need to grow.

What we’re doing:

- Connecting at the right places - tech meetups, summits, and shows where we meet peers, partners, and clients who are building interesting things.
- Bringing knowledge back home - capturing insights from every event through memos, podcasts, and OGIF sessions.
- Adding to the conversation - taking what we’ve learned and built, and sharing it back with the community.

# Workplace growth
## Return to the office: creating spaces where good work happens
We focused on making Hado office a productive and flexible space for focused work. Equipped with **Apple Studio Displays, Herman Miller chairs**, high-speed internet, and serene workspaces, it’s designed to help you get into the zone. Meeting rooms and 24/7 access offered flexibility when collaboration or quiet focus was needed.

We added perks like parking, lunch, and dinner subsidies to make the experience smoother. An automated check-in system at **🏢・lobby** rewarded every visit with **3 ICY**—a small gesture to keep us connected. Thanks to [@Tom](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/Tom) for streamlining this process.

## Summit 2024: Penang adventures that strengthened our team
December took us off the grid and into the heart of Penang, giving us a chance to step outside our screens and into shared adventures. The team naturally broke into their own rhythms: street food trails, heritage walks, challenge courses, or simply finding peace by the waves.

Every moment shared, every snapshot dropped into **🌉・moments**. ICY was nice, but the connections made? Unbeatable. Penang reminded us of what works best: trusting the team to chart their path.

Coming back home with stronger bonds, and the confidence that comes from seeing our team thrive both online and off. [Catch the full Penang story here.](https://memo.d.foundation/updates/changelog/2024-summit-building-bonds-our-way/)

# Onward 2025
Like crafting software, building Dwarves Foundation has been a journey of experimentation. Some things worked, some didn’t, but every year we’ve added something meaningful to the core.

2024 pushed us into interesting spaces - AI went from experiments to real tools, knowledge sharing turned into daily habit, and the community grew naturally. But this is just the beginning.

2025 opens with questions we're eager to answer, about tech, others about how we work. The best lines are yet to be written.

A strong team is built on its people and their beliefs. We're looking forward to the surprises ahead with all of you.
