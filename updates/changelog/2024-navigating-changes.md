### PURPOSE

For a long time, we've pursued innovation. It is our motivation. I believe that at some point, we don't want to take on boring maintenance work but instead focus on new ideas, exciting technology, or projects of significant value—not just routine tasks.

We are here to ship software, but what if we can't?

### COMPETENCY

Global competition is tough as the internet and technology continue to advance. To win and earn more, we have to compete with talent globally.

And let's be honest—some of us are falling behind. We need to move forward if we want to stay relevant and tackle more complex problems.

### FACTS

In the last few months, there have been deals in AI and Blockchain—not simple CRUD—that we wanted to participate in, but we didn't have a candidate to step up and handle the project. A few individuals are working on more than two projects at the same time, while the rest have less to do. 

In every ZIRP period, easy money floats around, creating the illusion that many are good enough to secure a job, earn, and flaunt their superiority, without successfully delivering results. We’ve all done great work in the past, but now it’s time to adapt.

The last tech cycle is ending, and we're already in the new normal. We are not in the best shape to compete with certain competitors, especially with a new market meta emerging.

### **ROAD AHEAD**

We are now in a future of new automation paradigms via AI and assets are moving on-chain. Enterprise-level requirements in these areas are still being considered by many.

The demand for traditional custom software is squeezing, with more clients opting for cost-effective, off-the-shelf solutions. And it’s hard for us to maintain the balance.

### NEXT

So, what’s next? We need to pause, regroup, and focus on growth. Here’s how we’ll move forward:

**Consulting**

For our consulting team, this means changes. We can't promise permanent engagement for everyone. If you're not actively contributing, you might feel the change. 

As a team, we're still observing the tech funding market, and until we can secure a decent number of jobs, you might need to take a break, improve ourselves, and look for new opportunities.

**Lab Team**

Our lab remains central to what we do, but with a sharper focus on innovation and discovery. Rewards for lab members will be increased accordingly.

New hires are required to perform under the lab team requirements (explore/write/apply).

**Alumni / Community**

Our community is our backbone. The Dwarves brand is nine years strong because of the relationships we've built, and everyone owns a piece of it.

Our Discord isn't just a chatroom; it will remain a hub of learning and connection for current and former team members. Members and alumni will receive a permanent **@d.foundation** alias email. 

Let’s continue to nurture this space.

### RECAP — TL;DR

1. The innovation market has changed progressively.
2. Our target customers are changing accordingly (Blockchain, AI, Data).
3. Our requirements for consulting members are changing.
4. Incompetent members or those without active contributing are seeing changes:
- We don't have work for your skillset.
- We can't justify the cost as clients believe others can do it more efficient.
- We might need to take a break in work.
- You will have a window of 15/30 days to adapt.
5. Team leaders will pick their A-team.
