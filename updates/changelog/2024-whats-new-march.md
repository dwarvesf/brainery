## ICY Updates in 2024
Since its launch in September 2022, ICY was used to reward the network members and allow all members to earn ICY through engagement in discussions, research on Dwarves' tech, and more.

In March:

- To welcome new members to our Discord discussions, we're giving away ICY to members with the @guest role as a warm welcome from us. Additionally, we've implemented a new role system to make it more fun and organized.
- We transferred the ICY contract from Polygon to the Base chain, paving the way for further NFT/staking advancements, with updated Mochi & Onchain balances.
- To expand our reach beyond Discord, we've initiated the linking of Mochi wallet accounts with GitHub accounts, rewarding linked users with ICY tokens.

## Community Engagement: Offline Meetups in April
Starting this April, we're excited to launch a fresh initiative focused on nurturing stronger connections and more meaningful interactions within our community. We'll trade our usual team dinners for engaging offline meetups held every three months in Ho Chi Minh City.  We can't wait to see you there.

## Demo and Showcase: Give your screenshots a cleaner look with Backr
The next initiative in our monthly call will have a broader range of topics to discuss, including project demos and product showcases.

- Elevate your screenshots with [Backr](https://getbackr.vercel.app/), a tool crafted by Tuan Dao. It allows you to set captivating backgrounds and make your captures look stunning.
- Also, our team member, Khac Vy actively participates in the weekly Solana event, Build Station, which is organized every Saturday. Reach out to Khac Vy if you're interested in joining. The "Build Station" offers developers a platform to connect, learn, and share experiences.

**Coming up:**

- Mark your calendars for our first offline meetup in Ho Chi Minh City (TBA).
