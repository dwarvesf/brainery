## The growing of memo pile
With the focus on Mastery, Meaning, and Autonomy (MMA) has driven significant growth in our brainery. This is evident from the increase in content submitted by our contributors on areas for work delivery, and foundational knowledge.

[memo.d.foundation](http://memo.d.foundation/), is creating a rich resource that both internal and community members can benefit from. Last month, Dwarvesâ€™ team members added several new entries from LLM, design patterns to blockchain concepts. Dwarves monthly rewards will be equally shared among all contributors.

## Enable reward for the learning system
Dwarves has always been a playground for techies, where learning and sharing go hand-in-hand. The increase in valuable content shared by our team and community members deserves greater recognition and rewards.

- Share your expertise in OGIF talks and earn 15-25 ICY per talk.
- Distill your OGIF insights into valuable notes on Memo and earn 10-15 ICY.
- Got a quick learning or discovery? Share it as a fleeting note and earn 3-5 ICY.
- Each link shared in **ðŸ’¡ãƒ»til, ðŸ’»ãƒ»tech** channels receive 1 ICY.
- Rewarding our top contributors weekly on Friday receives 3 ICY.
