## Dwarves community offline meet-up was a blast
We had a great time hosting our second Ho Chi Minh City meetup on May 31st. Over 50 awesome folks joined us for a night of tech talks, mingling, and all-around good vibes.

We chatted about what's been happening with Dwarves and heard updates from the community. Everyone seemed to have an engaging time, and we couldn't be happier with how it turned out.

A big thanks to community members: @jack, @tannhatcmcs, and @congiomat for their participation. Details of our next gathering will be shared soon. We hope to have more fun things for everyone to take part in the part.

## SPGroup WALA x Echelon Asia Summit 2024: New tech will shape the future
Last month, our team leaders @tieubao, @nikki, and @huytq attended the Echelon Asia Summit held in Singapore on May 15-16. The event focused on the future of Southeast Asia's tech and startup ecosystem, highlighting merger and acquisition trends and high-growth industries.

We had a chance to observe how investors and startups are changing their approach to using money, the evolution of AI, and upcoming projects in the APAC tech startup landscape. 

The foremost is we want to stay true to our path and keep innovating in ways that help our company and positively impact the broader tech ecosystem.

## From the last OGIF office hour: Building a resilient system
There have been many interesting discussions over the past two months since OGIF resumed. Topics ranged from new findings to techniques, software engineering, and industry insights. 

Notably, @hoangnguyen and @hieuthu2 gave an insightful talk on ‚ÄúBuilding a Resilient System.‚Äù They covered key aspects of system resilience, including designing for failure, implementing redundancy, and ensuring continuous availability.
