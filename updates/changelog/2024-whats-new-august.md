## Community engagement: memo notes, OGIF office hours, and tech discussions
Since we introduced the monthly pool for learning activities, the biggest impact has been the rise in real learning and discussions happening in memo notes, OGIF office hours, and discord network. Weâ€™ve made it simple for everyone to contribute.

Practical insights are brought to the table, and we work through them togetherâ€”no fluff.

Plus, thereâ€™s a new Fortress bot feature to check available ICY for grabbing, making it easier to see whatâ€™s up for grabs. 

Big thanks to the contributions from both the team and community: @tom, @lapnn, @theoctopus, @minhlq, @taipham, @vincent, @phucld, @julis, @antran, @innno_, @minh_cloud, @bienvh, @huymaius, @huytq, @datnguyennnx, @nam, @hieuthu1, @tristran.

## Link summaries with `sum` command
Weâ€™ve upgraded the **`sum`** command on our Discord to make it easier to get the important stuff. Now, with a summary opening, key points, and nuggets of knowledge, itâ€™s quicker to catch up on useful links. Special thanks to [@nam](https://github.com/namnhce) and [@tom](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/tom) for leading this improvement.

## Go enterprise solutions and what weâ€™ve learned
August brings a major update to our Go commentary. [@fuatto](https://memo.d.foundation/contributor/fuatto) has put together the Go Enterprise MOC, offering a clear look at how weâ€™re applying Golang to tackle enterprise challenges and highlighting how weâ€™re stretching its capabilities.

Weâ€™re still delivering our Go commentary weekly through OGIF sessions and memo notes. [Take a look here](https://memo.d.foundation/tags/go-weekly/).

## dfg token: earn by contributing
The **dfg token** has evolved from a private stock-like idea to a way to reward team members for their contributions. Itâ€™s part of our plan to build a brand we can all be proud of.

Originally tied to our Employee Ownership Program (EOP), the **dfg token** can now be earned through team activities. Contributions are tracked and rewarded with ICY coins. Soon, ICY will be required to earn the token.
