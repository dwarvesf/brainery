Another year has gone by. And we just celebrated the 5th year that we survived all the challenges. Everyone was facing their own, but I have seen many of you reaching new stages and achieve new targets.

We have been growing up together. As for your recall, end of 2018, we were about 30s. End of this year, we are about 50s. End of 2018, we were young and inexperienced. End of this year, we are just inexperienced.

The way we are running this organization is extraordinary, where new policies are focusing on putting people & technology in the heart of everything. Even though people come and go, their spirit stays. Dwarves Foundation is always the place the weirdest things could happen. And that gives me a strong belief in our promising future.

2019 was a tough year for all of us. We achieved a lot but also failed a ton. The strong team should be built on its people and their beliefs. None of us is as smart as all of us. Remember what Uncle Ho said about teamwork? I will not put it here but leave it to you.

Once again, on behalf of all the Dwarves, I want to say thanks to all of your contributions. The main theme of 2020 is 'The borderless software firm' and I'm looking forward to it with all of you.

Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰
