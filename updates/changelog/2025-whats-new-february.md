## The transition to hybrid mode: Strengthening team presence with coordination and perks
One month into the Hybrid Working model, and we‚Äôre picking up the pace. The shift from remote-first to hybrid means more structured office days, better team alignment, and a smoother workflow.

To keep things running efficiently, we‚Äôve:

- Coordinated team schedules so office days are planned with purpose.
- Workspace upgrades: Apple Studio Displays and Herman Miller chairs are now in place, with more improvements on the way.
- Added perks: lunch support, transport coverage (3 ICY per check-in), and stocked office supplies.
- Launched the Office Leaderboard with the office-lover role: shoutout to [@quang](https://github.com/lmquang) and [@vincent](https://github.com/tuanddd) for topping the chart this month. They‚Äôll enjoy a free drink for every office day next month as a reward.

More hands in, fewer blockers. Got ideas to make the workspace better? Drop them in üè¢„Éªlobby or open a support ticket. We‚Äôre listening.

## ICY to BTC transition: From experiment to the next chapter
ICY started in 2020 as our first community experiment, evolving into a reward system by September 2022. Since then, it has powered engagement, rewarding contributions in discussions, research, and beyond.

Last month, we demoed the ICY-to-BTC swap, a major step toward transitioning to a more sustainable and future-proof reward system. The swap interface is in place, and the mechanics are working. Now, we‚Äôre fine-tuning the final details before the official launch.

What‚Äôs next?

- Final testing and security checks.
- Launch announcement with a step-by-step guide.
- Support for a smooth transition.

Stay tuned for the final rollout.

## Reporting tech signal: Forward engineering 2024
In 2024, we‚Äôve mapped out key emerging technologies and their business impact to refine our technology roadmap and pinpoint the trends with the most potential across different markets.

Key highlights:

- AI agents are shifting from no-code to developer-driven workflows, with teams favoring self-hosted AI tools for better control.
- On the blockchain side, AI-powered on-chain actions are being explored for smart contract analysis and automated trading.
- Full-stack and AI/ML engineers remain the most sought-after roles, while AI automation is reshaping traditional software development. VC funding is leaning toward leaner, cost-efficient AI solutions.
- More to watch: AI governance, performance optimizations (DuckDB, WASM), and decentralized identity tech.

## Skip-level meeting: Open conversations with CEO 
Last month, Skip Level Meetings kicked off, offering a direct space to raise blockers, no back-and-forths, just a space to bring up challenges, new directions, feedback, and talk about what‚Äôs working (or not).  

Whether it‚Äôs about team operations, roadblocks in projects, or simply sharing thoughts on where we‚Äôre headed, this is a chance to have real discussions that drive change.

If there‚Äôs something on your mind, this is the place to discuss it.

## Annual health check-up: Keeping the team in check
We are preparing for the annual health checkup, ensuring everyone gets their routine screening done. Team members in HCM and Hanoi will have designated locations, while those from other areas can arrange travel to complete theirs.

For any questions, reach out to [@innno_](https://github.com/innnotruong).

## Health insurance renewal in progress
The Ops Team is managing the renewal process for our Bao Minh health insurance to ensure continuous coverage for everyone. Details are being finalized, and updates will be shared in the Basecamp thread once the process is complete. Stay tuned.

## Team moments: New year gathering & T·∫øt celebrations
We kicked off the Year of the Snake with our team reunion, creating space to share stories, reconnect, and set intentions for the year ahead. These moments remind us why we do what we do, building not just great technology but a community where everyone can thrive.
