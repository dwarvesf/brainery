## New memo command to boost team contributions

In the upcoming phase, the team will focus on streamlining processes and developing tools to make memo submission easier for everyone. Here are two ways we're helping you stay up to speed:

- Use commands like `?memo pr` and `?memo list` to check out the latest memos. Shoutout to @bienvh and @huymaius for this.
- Receive webhook notifications in the Discord server for new PRs, speeding up memo operations.
- Coming soon: Tools for submitting fleet notes directly on Discord and automating ICY distribution.

The amount of ICY distributed is still below the team's limit, so there's plenty of room for more contributions. Everyone can join hands.

We've seen a great increase in memo input from members this month. Here's the list for July:
