### More Dwarves join the brain team

Based on the vote on our latest all-hands, we have invited some Dwarves to start looking into new topics. Nhut, Hieu V, Minh L, Nam & Phat were onboarded last week. We started with the Architectural Diagram and some lineup topics (such as SaaS, Blockchain integration & Data Aggregator)

I think it's a meaningful activity for members who want to expand their knowledge and connect with others teammates. Hopefully to expand more on team size & new topics. We're calling for input on Web3 and DeFI. Just give @tieubao a ping and he'll help set you up.
