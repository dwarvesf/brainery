Health Insurance Renewal

We’re planning to move our current Bao Viet insurance to a better-beneficial package. The Ops Team is handling the transfer process and will keep you posted in this Basecamp thread <https://3.basecamp.com/4108948/buckets/9403032/messages/4618474560>. Drop @Gthan or me a ping if you have any questions on this.

Open Your Inquiry Ticket

Proudly introduce the Support Hub for Dwarves Team - If you have an inquiry for Ops team, just simply open a ticket. We’ll help resolve in real soon.

Skip Level Meeting

Book a casual chat to resolve what’s blocking you, either in work or life. It’s also a chance to hear your feedback on how the team is operating.
