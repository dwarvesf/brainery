COMMUNITY EARN
We do this so to encourage everyone to learn new things and/or engage with the rest of the team. Our quests are officially public, and there’s ICY to be earned for all the quests.

Have a look at (<https://earn.d.foundation>). There are multiple activities going on and anyone is welcomed to join hands.

WORLD CUP WRAP-UP
Well, after 64 matches, Sports fans all across the Dwarves network and communities united in the @world-cup-2022. Qatar 2022 World Cup finally reached its crescendo, we really appreciate @namnhce#9999 for hosting the show.
Now we have a budget of >16M for some good-time gatherings!

DALAT OFFICE
Looking for a short vacation, or new year's eve out of town? Sweet reminder, it’s the perfect weather to visit our Dalat Office. It’s open 24/7/365. The best way to start 2023, is a campfire at night, shall we? LGF @peeps
