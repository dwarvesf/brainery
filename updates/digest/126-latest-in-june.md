### Performance Review Announcement

As mentioned, we'll start the annual Performance Review next month. The specific procedure is as followed:

- You submit a one-to-two-page of self evaluation to your manager (or @thanh if you don't have one). You should use this template: <https://bit.ly/3HLw7Oj>. Examples of measurable impact and specific growth areas should be reflected from our career ladder: <https://bit.ly/3n8MoU3>
- You are also required to give feedback to your colleagues, managers, and subordinates.
- From your and peers' review, your managers will make their assessment. Then, we'll arrange a 1-hour performance discussion.
- Rating & salary review, then result announcement.
  If you have any questions, feel free to ping your manager, @thanh or @thuongptt directly.
