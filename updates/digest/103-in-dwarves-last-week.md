### The team

Blockchain-based direction keeps us on discovering new knowledge. Earlier today, Hieu walked us through a 101 session on Solana Blockchain Platform. The file was recorded at <https://bit.ly/3ym95c6> - in case you missed it - many thanks to Minh
We start to welcome more blockchain guys to Dwarves Discord. You may find them in #introduction channel. If you're new here, stop by and introduce yourself as well 👾

DOTY 2021 is finalizing. Voting maybe open by the end of this week 😏
