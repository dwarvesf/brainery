### Standardize tech progress: Diagram

A few weeks earlier, our Tech team had decided to level up our current tech progress, starting with the Restful API design. At this time, Diagram.md describes how we create diagram using Mermaid.

I also found some articles on Medium while searching on this Markdown diagram tooling, hope you can find it helpful.

- Create Charts & Diagram using Markdown-like Syntax
- Making Diagram Fun with Mermaid
  Heard that they are working on the logging (a well-defined process to track what happens in the system) and monitoring (how we implement the application-specific checks to monitor the overall status of the application health). The latest update will be put at dwarvesf/playbook/engineering.

### News Dwarves join the team

Weâ€™re glad to welcome Truong Anh (or you may find her account as Oliu in Basecamp) last week as our new Biz Dev for the Ventures arm. Hope you have a great experience with the Dwarves, create impact and enjoy the ride.
