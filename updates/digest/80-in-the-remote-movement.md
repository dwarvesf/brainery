## Team & quality

### Metrics dashboard

Tin has finished setting up the metric for SaaS (contains the document and setup script), a part of Venture’s product bootstrapping.

Using dashboard and metrics to measure a product’s health brings a visualized result and enhances the business decision; which is why we also adopt this on Fortress, by creating dashboard to visualize our current data and business movement.

### QC: automation testing framework

As mentioned lately, QC Team is building an automation testing framework to apply on all current projects. The workflow has been setup with a detailed guideline for development team to trial and awaiting for further updates.

## In the remote movement

### Dragon bound & Wayfinder

Going fulltime remote drives us to think of a new bonding way. Dragon Bound and Wayfinder will be hosted and livestream this weekend. For more info, please catchup on discord/campfire.

### Gather town - where remote doesn’t feel remotely

We’re starting to adopt Gather town - a vphysically office space for team gathering. The UI and experience somehow feels like those games back in the 2000s. Cool. The bits team had taken the first step in Gather for their weekly meeting, how about you ? Join us at

## News of the week

Window’s leak on new Win version

Win11 is otw, and rumors has it that it's more like a cross of Win10 and Win10X: A refresh desktop interface, where the highlight falls for all rounded-corner icons and middle taskbar. Tracing back to the claim that Win10 is the last version of Win, where MSFT plans to implement in the era where things revolves around smartphones rather than PCs, this move is more like a marketing than a release.

But then the hit of Covid that turns everyone's focus back to PCs, this might be the ship out to keep up with the movement? The expected Win11 will be unveiled by Jun 24.

The trial on M1

A short blog post on a 3-month journey of using Apple M1 chip, which I believe is kinda related to our team lately. I guess we’re all agree that M1 performs splendidly on the processing speed and the robust battery life. Until the running of Docker and other applications cause slow performance, not to mention the consumption of disk space for editors like Xcode. Like all of us, the author witnessed the same points. How’s your journey with M1 so far ?
