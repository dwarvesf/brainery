### Can we achieve 30% profit with Uniswap yield farming
@baskin (community member) asked @phucld about the feasibility of achieving a 30% profit by putting $1M worth of BTC and/or ETH into Uniswap's WBTC/ETH liquidity pool, aiming to maintain the initial amount and achieve monthly and yearly profit targets.

@phucld jumped in with some helpful insights: it's possible with skilled management of price range, trading volume, and impermanent loss. He also pointed to tools like Arrakis Finance for managing price ranges and PoolFish for APR simulations to assess potential earnings.

*Pro tip*: sticking with pairs that tend to move together can make your life easier. [Check out the convo here](https://discord.com/channels/462663954813157376/1216788839880724562/1251504848583655515).

@hnh and @hieuthu2 discussed how issuing dividends in shares can affect ownership value and market price. They explained that while the overall value of the company might remain the same, the value per share could change, which is crucial for investors to understand.

The conversation also touched on broader banking and market predictions.
