Hope you got a great time last weekend with the fam.

Been a year with so many changes. Let’s all sit down and walk through them in our next December All-hands meeting this Friday, Dec 31 🤙 Hope to see all of your there!

DOTY is still opening for those last votes. We currently have 38 voting so far. Please be noted that we strongly welcome you to nominate yourself, and input the valuable ideas to level up this team. We’re all ears to receive.

This afternoon Team Showcase was recorded in case you missed it. 2 last topics will be continued in the next Tuesday ✌️
