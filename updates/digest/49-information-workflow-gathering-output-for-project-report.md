### Information workflow

Previously, we have known about auto-release, you know, where the bot keeps update the latest status of development. Quynh has spent her time to double check the release changelog after signing it off to go to production from one hub only.

Khai and Duy will help collect the release output and convert them into document form. This will then be used for monthly project report which can be distributed in 2 audience groups: Internal (for team’s tracking) and External (for product owners and clients).

We also thinking of setting this up based on sprint, since each projects has its own sprint timeline. It’s better to wrap up a sprint with a detailed summary of what we have done, grab the lesson learnt and improve the work quality gradually.
