### Company updates

Rolling out schedule plan for Year-End Party

Our Operation team has finished the agenda for our 2019 Year End Party. This year party is hoped to be a memorable night, as it doesn't only to award our Dwarves of The Year for their hard work, but also to mark our 5 years journey. Guys, Dwarves Foundation is turning 5!

The party will be held at the beginning of January, according to the latest plan.

Agenda for Apprenticeship Program

Another great project to follow up. Apprenticeship Program is expected to start in February, the time we get back to work from Lunar New Year. So far, our Recruiter is working on addressing the appropriate resources to and drafting the timeline. The specific workflow and syllabus for the program will be the goal for next week, based on 4H method.

Learning Google Technologies

A full day hands-on workshop to experience Google's technology. Phat Nguyen - our Back-end engineer attended as a speaker with the talk Golang fundamentals & How to build an API server with Golang

  UML Stencil Kit

Omnigraffle is a tool that allows you to create and store your mindmaps, charts, layouts and every visual plan you need for your business. Once you've created and exported a version as an Omnigraffle file, you won't need to redraw it again.

Adapting this useful aspect, Ly N. is drafting a branding kit for Dwarves Foundation team using Omnigraffle. UML Stencil Kit will be utilized for internal purpose to create diagrams.
