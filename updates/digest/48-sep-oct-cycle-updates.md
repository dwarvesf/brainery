### Sep-Oct Cycle Updates

We’ve wrapped up another cycle of 2020. Road to the end of 2020, our next step will move forward to extending community work, finish our current products, enhance the tech practice adoption and hopefully to come up with some new course for training.

The detailed changelog has been updated in Woodland Message Board, in case you missed it.

and yes, hope you all felt great with the team retreat last night at Bia Craft. I mean, based on the photo, I can tell.
