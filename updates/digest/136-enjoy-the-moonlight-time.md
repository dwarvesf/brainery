Enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival 🥮

By the time reading this, I hope all of us have received the Mooncake gift. Mid-Autumn is coming closer and on behalf of the team. I wish you all a great time with your loved ones.

Grow big & better ✔️

Happy to announce we’ve wrapped up Sep Performance Review. Besides the details feedback summary, updated notes for salary increment have also reached your inbox. Congratulation and thank you for all the hard work.

Get some $Icy 🧊

As mentioned in the latest All-hands, $ICY would be the official token to encourage all participants in the Dwarves Network. We aim to see what happens if we combine the best features of an open business with a community. Participating in server events is a certain way to amass Icy. To learn more, visit #icy.
