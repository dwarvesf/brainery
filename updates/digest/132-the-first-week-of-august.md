Welcome and kudos
Congrats @namnd, @bachwilshere, @mirageruler , and @datpv, on your successful completion of the probationary period. Wishing you a happy and productive work at Dwarves.

Community peeps, we love to have you around
We're glad to send @Trương Quốc Tuấn, a very familiar friend, these Dwarvish items for his vigorous activities in Discord. We've noticed the constant sharing, and let's just say we can't wait to see more of the likes.

Getting prep for Mid-autumn Festival
Mid Autumn is coming closer, and so is our prep to make it more memorable. We'll be rounding up the contact info for Mooncakes delivery next week and, hopefully - some Discord activities to hype up the day. Stay tuned.

First iOS note from the team
Proud to announce that we've got the first iOS note on Brainery, thanks to the contributions of @Trung Phan. August Brainery Batch has opened, and as usual, we welcome every effort. Open a PR at <https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain> and drop your first note.
