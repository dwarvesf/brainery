New Dwarves in town
We are excited to introduce @RemyR999 as our Marketing & Branding executive. He’ll work with the Operations team to help enhance our social exposure.

Next Tshirt batch coming soon
We’ve just announced the size chart last Thursday (<https://bit.ly/3CbTWOT>). Also, a small hint that we’re on the way to completing our merchandise kit.

Mid-Autumn Festival is coming
Mooncake Gift will be delivered to your door around September. In this sheet (<https://bit.ly/3SNDwlB>), please recheck your delivery contact or input the address details if you haven't.
