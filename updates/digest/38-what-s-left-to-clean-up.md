### Cycle Wrap-up

Next week would be our last week of Aug. I know, scary. Another cycle is about to come and how can this year went by so freaking fast.

Anyway, please spend time to take a look at roadmap todo and wrap up your work. The cycle review should be conducted on Aug 27 and I hope to receive the wrap up note for your todo before then.

### Mid-Autumn Gift Delivery

Mid-Autumn Festival will reach us around the beginning of October. Van has helped to order a small gift for each of us. Since we’re all working remote now, have the gift delivered to your doorstep would be a great solution. Just fill out your address in this form before Aug 31.

The delivery time will be around Sep 18-22. If you’re happen to stop by block B at that time, just come in and pick up your gift.
