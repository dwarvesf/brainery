### Apprenticeship update

After 3 weeks of rolling out, Apprenticeship has finally ready for the first training period with 8 members onboarded, from engineers to designers. We'll soon gather the seniors for the trainer team and come up with a detailed strategy.

### Workflow & quality enhancement

Communication Heed

Communication somehow is still an issue of collaboration amongst teammates. We strongly encourage the check-in message in the team project to better help synchronize the work status.

QC Team

QC Team will dive deeper into system design to enhance quality control based on [V-model](<https://www.guru99.com/v-model-software-testing.html>. Besides, white box testing will also be taken to trial.

Project Changelog flow

As you all know, for the past few weeks, project changelog has become a thing. Previously, we received them from the team as Basecamp Message board, gave it a bit format, and sent them out as emails to the client every Saturday.

From now on, we'll collect the changelog from your Basecamp message, turn them into markdown format & sync them toÂ GitHub. By storing them on our GitHub, we hope to improve our experience as a software engineer team.

The output of this is a part of the artifacts we need for Project Compliance.

Project Compliance

Our current projects will soon comply based on a list of artifacts. To sum up, this means the project can only be considered "qualified" once it fully contains the necessary artifacts. This artifact list will be defined by Khai, and we could start the compliance process right after that.

These artifacts will later then become our intellectual property. Once a project is wrapped up and archived, the list will be stored as data on our Fortress system.

### Kudos

- Nam T for her active work on techie.story and crafting two new pieces of knowledge: Dotfiles & Design System, and Quang & Thanh for spending time sharing the topics
- Hieu Vu for the good work in his new project that led to an appreciation from our client
- Quynh Le & Quang L for try out Testlink & k6 to upgrade our tech stack

### News recap

Kotlin Multiplatform

The latest handshake for Android and iOS. With the same approach of UIKit, where a single codebase can be written for the business logic of iOS and Android apps, Kotlin Multiplatform doesn't place any restriction on how the app's UI should be developed. In fact, the Kotlin syntax is even easier for iOS developers since it's based on the same modern concepts they are used to.

Google vs Oracle

According to the Supreme Court, who handed Google a victory over the battle: Prewritten programs are shortcuts for developers. This inevitably raised an opinion wave: Should this be considered a legal exculpation for open-sourced or a proof of patent violation?

FB and the continuous fault in Data breach

FB belike oops, I did it again. Leaked info has been verified by matching phone numbers with the ID list in the data set. The 533 million records are an entirely different data set that attackers created by abusing a flaw in a Facebook address book contacts import feature.
