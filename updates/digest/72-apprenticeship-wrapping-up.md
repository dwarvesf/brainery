### Apprenticeship wrapping up

Apprenticeship has been wrapped up with 12 new Dwarves in the woodland. With 5 FE, 4 BE, and 3 Designers, we hope to collaborate with them to make this team more diverse in terms of skill set and culture.

### What's next for Project Artifacts List

We've finalized the project artifacts list last week and have it updated for the team leads. We'll be setting it up on Gitlab and pull those source codes down to local. Meanwhile, QC Team will also set up their weekly report based on the changelog format.

### Finalizing the cycle

We're getting closer to the end of this cycle. Apr 01 to Apr 24 real quick, I know. I'm freaking out too ðŸ¥².

We'll be holding a cycle review next week, probably fall to Apr 29 (Thursday). I'm crafting up the March/April Changelog and see how far we've come. Please help input your finished todos into the Roadmap list and add up goals for the next one.

### News of the week

Apple Spring Event Recap

The long-awaited didn't let us down. With the introduction of M1 iMAC, M1 iPad Pro, 4k Apple TV, and the star of the slew - AirTag - a very Apple-y product twists the tracking system for all Apple products.

And, of course, the primary privacy changes. The new iOS announced to restrict advertising tracking, which requires developers and advertisers to comply with the new rule, and leave Facebook with the unanswered question: How much will it hurt the small business?

Given these new drops, Apple has evidently put a lot of effort into ensuring privacy and safety for its users while expanding the ecosystem.

GCP vs Azure & AWS

An article explained how GCP happened to be distrusted comparing to other cloud providers such as AWS or Azure. It listed some key points that made GCP (and somehow other Google products ) harder for developers. There have been some debates on HN as well, where mono-repo is the highlight pain point.
