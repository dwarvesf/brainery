### Kick-off CSR program: social impact / NPO support

CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) is a program where we aim to offer discount or free-of-charge for website development to solve social causes using technology products.

Our first move is the partnership with SCI (Salt Cancer Initiative) where we help to build up a mobile app to connect cancer patients with events that fits their need.

This type of partnership is under-considered to become one of our service list.

### New dwarves in the team

  It’s great to have you on board. Hope you spend a quality time with the team and gain many achievements.

### Insurance renewal

Our Bao Viet Insurance has been renewed lately. Van has uploaded a list of batch 1 here. The new cards can be picked at our office, just ping Van in advance if you want to come by and grab yours.

### Performance review

Our performance review is still undergoing. For those who haven’t gotten your review yet, we’re still arranging the work and will come up with a schedule in no time. Meanwhile, ping Huy N should you have any question or just simply feel like being mean to him.
