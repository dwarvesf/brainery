### Collect Bao Viet insurance card

Bao Viet insurance card has been picked up. You can stop by HaDo office and grab yours - and ping Van in advance.

### Farewell to An Duong

An's solid performance was highly valued by our client that led him become a full-time guy there. An will be one of the first engineers of their Vietnam tech team.

But that doesn't mean he stops being one of us - you'll always be welcomed in this woodland. Hope to see you hang around Discord ðŸ‘¾

### New Dwarves in town

Glad to have new guys to expand the squad. They'll be joining us in project work of as Backend & Fullstack Engineers. Welcome onboard Tom, Jim & Hung ðŸš€

\*Note

I just cant believe I have to craft this line myself. But this Wednesday holds the National Woman Day - Van & Nam are preparing some gifts for our female Dwarves. The gift will be delivered in short and I truly wish you all have a great day. From HaNoi with â™¡
