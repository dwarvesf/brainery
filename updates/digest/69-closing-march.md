### Team expansion

BE team is getting bigger

After two weeks of rolling out, we've managed to widen the team with the news Apprentices: 4BE, 2FE, and 1 Designer. The onboarding process is currently happening, and the training period is expected to happen in 2 weeks. We'll come up with the wrap-up message soon.

We're calling for Marketing Executive

Time to have someone taking good care of our social channels. We're looking for someone with inbound marketing experience and the willingness to grow our audience base. The full JD is crafted at dwarvesf/marketing-executive.

### Quality enhancement

Engineering Quality

So far, we're doing good with the quality standard. But there are some fields we need to touch. In the next few months, Software Architecture and Solution Design are our main focus. We believe this is what the team needs to bring a better impact in service and consultancy.

Polish Team profile

We'll go hard on promoting our delivery standard as a part of branding exposure. The team collects testimonials and client reviews, publishing our deliverables through email changelogs & public social faces. We're making good progress. It's great to stay tuned for those great project recaps every Friday.

### Community

We'll be rolling out two newsletters. The direction is finalized.

- Community Newsletter: Collaborating with guest writers from tech communities, this newsletter aims to provide observations and what's happening in tech throughout the sums-up articles and event listing. From the Dwarves input, Han & Duy are taking care of the agenda.
- Venture Newsletter: By breaking the successful startups into case studies, we're able to tailor this newsletter for venture partners and the startup community by noting down our progress highlight and the domain insight. Ngoc will spend her time leading the product team to ensure the newsletter can cover knowledge from different perspectives

### Kudos

### News recap

An IDE to create responsive emails

As newsletters have been invading my work lately, finding this tool is pretty nice. An IDE that combines visual and code for email marketing and newsletter. Designs from MailStudio can be exported as standard HTML and import to anywhere of choice.

git-plan

Your tool should be designed to switch context when you do. A developer (maybe) explained how the current git commit workflow isn't working so well. He came up with a magic pill, git plan commit that allows developers to use the previously-written plan as a template to commit message. It's open-sourced too, for anyone who wants to contribute.
