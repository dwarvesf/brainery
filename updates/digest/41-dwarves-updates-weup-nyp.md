### Internship Review

After 2 months of internship, Phuc, Hoang & Khoi will resume their study at Bach Khoa University, while Tri continues his journey with us. We hope you had a great time and continue your good work in the future.

### Dwarves Foundation <> NYP

Previously, we were about to provide NYP (Nanyang Polytechnic) students an environment for internship and skillset training, but the plan was postponed during Covid. NYP has recently contacted us for further partnership, catching up with our current status and working on some new ideas for collaborations.

### Hill Chart Adoption

As updated in the last digest, the team has gradually input their working progress, which made things easier to visualize and keep everyone posted. Everything is still on the trial stage. We do expect to utilize this tracking method for better project milestone management.

### Operation Optimization

One of our goals this cycle is to upgrade the current workflow and create a better journey for our clients, partners & the Dwarves team as well. Giang, Van, Nam & Duy are spending their time on this. By redesign the experience flow of each group, we expect to optimize every of our delivery from customer happiness, employee experience and better partnership.

### Memo: Go the extra mile

A small post on our aspect for work. Going the extra mile can be seen as a standard to distinguish the good and the outstanding. Having the spirit of going extra at work means you donâ€™t settle for average, but aiming to deliver beyond the expectation.
