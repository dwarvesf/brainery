### Roll out console.so with Notion

We launch a new branch for blockchain development atÂ console.so. Building with Notion is efficient. We currently have it on 2 websites:

- console.so
- turingalley.com
  Are you adopting Notion? How's the experience so far?

### Expanding the dwarves

August starts with good news. More inquiries are coming, and they are looking for help with technical consulting alongside software development.

We welcomed 3 new members to the Dwarves team last week. The hiring still goes on to thicken the senior layer. We're expecting to fill a few more vacant positions:

- 3 x Frontend, React.js
- 1 x Product Designer
- 1 x Marketing Executive

### Find your highlight work at Memo

Our projects case studies are uploaded on Memo. Duy wants to thank you all for spending time doing fact checks and help accurate the info. Checkout the latest one at: memo.d.foundation.

Type `case study` in the search box. That saves you a lot of time.

They feature the technical highlight aspects in our product shipment. And more than that, it reflects our lessons learned through each project and how we grow as a team.

### Project auditing

Sometimes, there will be an issue internally of the team collaboration workflow, base knowledge sync in, pick up the wrong approach, and so on that cause technical or management debt.

Last week Han started applying the compliance process into one of our projects, together with Khai, Ly, Khanh, Vy, and Huyen; and he did find out a list of items that we could do better. The following audit session will be on Tuesday.

### Learning smart contract

With several blockchain projects being worked on, the number of Dwarves who could write smart contracts has increased recently.

I think it's like learning a new API interface and easy to pick up. Huy, Tay, Quang, Phuc equipped themselves. You are encouraged to do so.

### Reminder on performance review

Around 15s performance review sessions were conducted last week, and many more are to come. If you haven't submitted your self-review, please do shortly and schedule a 1-1 with your leader next week.
