### Dwarves totem

I was gonna save the totem sample photo for this digest, but since anh Han have mentioned it in our latest All-hands meeting, I got no choice but to repost it here. Some of the Dwarves have claimed theirs at block B.

We have received a few update photos. If you have collected your keychain. pin badge, let’s drop some pic in the comment thread! 💪🏻

### Contributions

Hard work pay off, as usual. We genuinely send our congrats to your all great work for the first volume of TechRadar; especially for Phuc, Bien & Khoi - those top 3 nominees voted by our fellas.

You can find further updates and link to other topics here, or have a check at our Medium.

### Hill chart

We have a few new ideas with Basecamp Hill chart. By filling the specific milestone of each projects, Huy N and Khai are utilizing Hill chart to visualize the project progress and make it easier to see the big picture. This aims to effectively organize the workflow and keep everyone on the same page.

### New dwarves in town

We welcomed Hieu Ngo to join us as a Frontend Engineer. Mentored by Minh T, hope he’ll spend his time at Dwarves to increase his skill and gain great achievement.
