- In case you don’t know, it’s open for non-Dwarves who are eager to learn in our server.

### Annual health checkup result

- As @Gthan announced in #lobby, your health checkup result will be sent through your email by next week. Finger cross, everyone is in their good state.

### Have fun with our weekly minigame

- New things in town - we got minigames with a small prize happening every Thursday on our server for @everyone to get to know one another and have some cool-off time.
- Stay tuned and even better tell your friends to join. More people more prizes.
