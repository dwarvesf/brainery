### More Dwarves join the brain team

Peeps, have you picked up reward from last month yet? In the mean while, Dwarves start looking into new topics

- Frontend: ViteJS Native Modules <https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/43> by @namth
  Hopefully to expand more on team size & new topics. We're calling for July input on Web3 and DeFI. Just give @thanh or @Tom a ping and they'll help set you up.

### Performance Review

For those who havenâ€™t gotten your peer review yet, weâ€™ll come up with a schedule in no time. Ping @thanh or @thuongptt if you have any question.

For the referral cases lately, weâ€™ll be sending a confirmation note on the effective referral bonus. If youâ€™re unsure on your referral case, just ping @itsmia. Other than that, weâ€™re glad to proceed if you got any potential CVs. Just open an ðŸŽ«ãƒ»inquiry-ticket.

### Meet @Tom at the next Google I/O Extended Cloud HCM 2022
