# 142 - The return of Tech Radar

@peeps If you didn't know, now you do. After a short break, Tech Radar is back with its 4th edition.
â€¢ We use tech radar to decide if a technology is worth adding into our tech stack. With@Tom's leading, tech radar #4 is coming along. Have a look here: <https://radar.d.foundation/>

â€¢ You can also help spread the words on tech radar by sharing / reacting to this announcement:

â€¢ Don't be an outsider. We want everyone to contribute to the Tech Radar, as it's something that will be applied to your work at Dwarves. Come find Tom when you're ready to contribute.

Upgrading Brainery

â€¢ Weâ€™re in the process of upgrading the Brainery website to make it easier for everyone to navigate and contribute. You can look forward to it.
â€¢ @Giang | Janr Vu gave a talk on the note-taking methods we use at Dwarves. Reach out to Giang if you have any questions. Full Learning Talk at: <https://youtu.be/rO9jYOUlxxs>

Tech Events

â€¢ We had a great time talking with Mombyâ€™s team about their social impacts and startup journey. In case you missed the show, the full stream is here:

â€¢ The ask: if you have anyone / anything want to talk to / cover, let the Communication team know. Weâ€™ll try our best to make it happen. Simply open a ticket in ðŸŽ«ãƒ»community-support-ticket or ping @nikki directly World Cup Season

â€¢ Almost a tradition, we try to have fun with World Cup. @thanh and @hnh are working up a scheme for us to place bets supporting our fav football teams and engage with other Dwarves. Wild

Wins to celebrate

â€¢ Hungpt passed his probation! Weâ€™re happy to have you here, and we look forward to working on great things together. Congrats, mate.
â€¢ Amiee joined our Communication team recently. Already sheâ€™s hustling.
â€¢ Itâ€™s not everyday that clients think of us as ones of their own. Seems like they loves us, as they sent over merch swag for the whole team. Come pick up yours at our Hado office, or contact Nhuthm if you need help.

Last but not least,

â€¢ @itsmia decided to embark on a new journey, meaning she had to part ways with Dwarves for the time being. Goodbyes donâ€™t have to be sad, as weâ€™re happy knowing sheâ€™s pursuing exciting things everyday.
â€¢ Duy, thank you for everything you have done at Dwarves, you will always be a friend to us all. Keep on shining.

Til next time á••(âœ§â—ž âœ§)á•—
