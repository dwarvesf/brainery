### Team updates

Jun Update: Cleaning up the Roadmap

Weâ€™re getting closer to the end of June. The May-Jun roadmap is getting checked up, and the Ops team is preparing for cycle updates on our upcoming All hands meeting, which takes place next Friday, July 02. Hope to see you there. ðŸ¤ž

Covid is getting serious

As we have known, Saigon has recently faced the massive spread of Covid, of which the closest drop was the F0 case at HaDo. Usually, team dinner will be held at the end of every two months, but it seems like we might have to postpone it until the situation gets better. Stay safe and keep us posted on your home desk setup ðŸ‘ˆ

Notion Adoption

Low code has been a rise lately, and our team is stepping in the trend. We did have Notion in early 2018, but not until the latest release that we started to dig deeper on this tool. We are migrating some side projects with static website to Notion, as itâ€™s quick (and fun) to build up a website.

### News of the week

Brave search beta version

Brave bought Tailcat an independent search engine 3 months ago, promising to create a private, non-tracking alternative to Google search. Tailcat makes use of its own index and doesn't depend on third party search engines. By setting it apart from third-party solutions, Brave prevent user's info from being tracked and leveraged. Some highlight in Brave beta that might catch the eye

- No record on user IP
- Uses anonymous cookie to save preferences
- No ads
- Search results stay adequately, but can still mix on third party to better serve the queries.
  GitHub Issues new features

GitHub is bring a spreadsheet-like canvas into their issues and pull request, making things easier for team collaboration through customized views. The new feature helps break issues into actionable tasks, supports auto-merge on pull request and dependency review. Github Discussion also provides a space to work on daily FAQs through open-ended conversations.

and ofc, pretty much sums up the rollout of Windows 11 with full discussion of HN community.
