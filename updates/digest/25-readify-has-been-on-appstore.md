### Celebrate the 1st Milestone of Dwarves Foundation

Yah we know it's been 2 cycles (which means 4 months already) since our 5th Anniversary, thank God the feeling is still there to craft up this recap.

We're looking back the past journey with pride and heading to the next one with excitement. For those who have just joined the gang, taking a good look at this will help you understand more on what we've walked through the last five years.

### Software Development Life Cycle

Conducted by Khai Le & Huy Nguyen, this workshop contains the basic knowledge on Software Development Life Cycle, provides people with a step-to-step guideline and the artifacts which will be created on the way.

### Adjust the way we work, in Basecamp style

Being in a remote team is dope. Manage your own stuff, remove the time and cost of commuting, select your work ambiance, and got equipped with all types of supporting tools.

Our path with Basecamp didn't cross by accident. Moving the whole theme to Basecamp wasn't easy, especially when we have gotten used to the small daily talks. At first, there wasn't much conversation transpire in Basecamp. We only touch it for project briefing and note down the to-do list.

As time goes by, we're getting closer to the part where Basecamp acts as a great supporter of team communication & project development. Basically, this is how we organize things, in one place. Read the full article at Dwarves Memo - Adjust the way we work, in Basecamp style
