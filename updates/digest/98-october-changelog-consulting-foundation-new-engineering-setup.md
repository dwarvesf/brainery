Greetings from Ops, I know it's a bit late, but I promise to keep this short and to the point - like our latest All-hands üåø

### CONSULTING

---

We're glad to receive multi requests for tech services. That shifts us closer to the goal:¬†Make project decisions based on tech focus, scaling ability & branding advantage.

Some of our prjs were re-evaluated.¬†We're reserving the team for better collaboration.¬†The constantly hiring work is made to support this.

A bigger team size requires better management effort.¬†We're having a PM layer for every current/upcoming project. This resolves the bottleneck & puts teammates on a broader view. The first-hired PM should be joining us in November.

A few notable update

- A new client came to the table - A Singaporean leading utility group for sustainable energy solutions in the Asia Pacific. Minh Tran, Trung Phan, Chinh Le, Cuong Mai, Hoang Nguyen, Quang Mai will join the development team.
- Scaling: We're happy to know several of our projects are expanding the work with Dwarves Foundation in various engineering positions.

### ENGINEERING

---

We're glad to welcome the new members to join the woodland. Also, a big congrats to these Dwarves for successfully surpassing the probation time. Once again, it's great to have y'all here ü§úü§õ

To scale the team, we obviously need to upgrade the internal. Run by Thanh & Huy G, there're some practices to support the team's career growth.

All are trialing from November. Let's see how it turns out in our next performance review.

### FOUNDATION

---

Having more Dwarves is the long-term growth - would be nice to have them all over the country (and global).

We've found a¬†spot for our Hanoi fellows. It'll go official once the team has met ~ 5-10 Dwarves.

Our Dalat Office is ready to serve. As transport has slowly gone back to normal, I hope to see some pic taken from our Dwarves there.

### COMMUNITY

---

That's a wrap for October! 2 months left to finish 2021. Idk about you, but I'm counting for more good news at work, and a splendid team dinner by the end of Dec. The virtual cheers have been running long enough üçª
