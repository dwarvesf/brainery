Lunar New Year Gift set will reach you soon in the next few days. Pls help to notice your phone calls. We hope you enjoy the combo ♡ If so, let’s drop the pic in #company-hall.

In the Team

We got @Nam as our new UX Designer, and @Thuong has joined the team as our Operation Executive. May you find this woodland a great place to grow.

Our seniors & mid-levels have started to recruiting their like-mind teammates. Some of our projects are stretching and we place the priority in finding more Dwarves.

Social Exposing

A small steps for our knowledge training path - Dwarves Youtube has been revamp with well-formatted topics from Weekly Radio Talk. All amazing credit goes to @Wigeon the newly Community gal.
