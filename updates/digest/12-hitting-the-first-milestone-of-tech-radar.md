### Team Status Update üì¢

You may recall the last All Hands meeting where many of our action items got blocked and created a bunch of mess. It's been 2 months since then and we can't help but notice that the team is gradually getting back on track

That reveals through the collaboration between Operation, Hiring and Engineering. The team also did a great job of automating most of the operating process and leave the human resource for what matters more.

### Publish FAQ and final result page üìç

We're about to reach the end of Tech Radar - version 1! It's one week left until your work is showcased and as mentioned in the last Digest, we polished an exhibit page for you already at Dwarves Tech Radar.

Don't forget we had chosen GitHub repo to store our material instead of Google Drive. GitHub makes it more suitable to manage and display your work visually. By next Thursday, Feb 27th, please create PR for your topic following the README instruction here.

Some of the exciting topics will be chosen as the shining stars at our next Engineering meeting on Friday, Feb 28th! We'll meet you there üí™

### TransferWise Update ‚ú®

Next week should be the 2nd payment through TransferWise, the borderless bank account we rolled out since January.

After the 1st trial, though some of the Dwarves had trouble with withdrawing and transferring the money to your local bank, it's safe to say this type of payment is making good progress.

For further steps, we're considering making the payment 1 or 2 days in advance. This adds more time for the transferring between TFW account and your Vietnam account to make sure your local bank receives the income by the time you need
