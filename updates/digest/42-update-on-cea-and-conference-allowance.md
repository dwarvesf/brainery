### Conference & Education Allowance

As a part of employee package, this allowance applies for all field of studying (yes you heard me), as long as it helps you grow. Lately, we’ve added up some changes, particularly in prerequisite and the place where you can input your request. For detailed information, check out the latest update at Dwarves Handbook.

### Memo Update: Infinite Image Gallery

While we were conducting the series of Software Craftsmanship @DF, Lap threw out a topic of Audio Visualization using ThreeJS. This time, he got back to this library with an infinite image gallery, heard he was inspired by Bien Joue’s work. Lap has also noted down his journey here, quite fascinating.

### New Restful API Design

Previously, our engineers generate API designs based on their own terms & definition. Gathering all the common practices, we’ve developed our first version of Restful API design, to systemize a standard format to make sure we speak the same voice. The detail can be found here at our Playbook. Also, a presentation will be made next week for further discussion.
