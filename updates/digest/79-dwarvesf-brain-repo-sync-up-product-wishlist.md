### News of the week

Apple WWDC 2021

This time WWDC also supports more videos to illustrate the news in SwiftUi, marking the effort in supporting mobile app development.

However, after a few days of trial, some of us do realize Apple FaceTime doesn‚Äôt function as neat as it should be. It gets lagged and blocks down the activity of others task while the call is happening. What else happen in your experience so far ?
