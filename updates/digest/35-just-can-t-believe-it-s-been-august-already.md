Yep, Covid has back in the area. Needless to say, wfh is recommended. Again.

A week ago, we were this close to book our annual company trip in the very Da Nang. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s the sign from the universe or something, but itâ€™s definitely freaks me out.

Anyhoo, letâ€™s wrap up July.

### Memo invasion

The past week has been a loaded up for our Memo. From a blank space with few blog posts about Homebrew, Dockers or the DC/OS series, weâ€™re filling up Memo with new collections, engineering topics research, design aspects and operation perspectives.

Innovation: Innovation is one of the core values weâ€™re pursuing. Lately, a.Han kicked off this topic with a write up. On the journey of innovation, exploring the possibilities is claimed as the most vital. But there are this exploration and that exploration. The Adjacent Possible is how he explains the target of successful exploration and expansion.

I also crafted up a short note on hiring. I figure this sensitive period (yes I mean Covid) might again put off the hiring stuff and itâ€™s a good time to talk about our view on it.

Besides, you may heard the term Tech Radar for the past few months. Although the team is still working on creating a website for the radar itself, we think itâ€™s safe to start posting the first two topics: SwiftUI by Phuc and Applied Security Basis created by Bien, Khoi and Phuong.

### Readify progress

Weâ€™ve just had a demo session on the latest version of Readify. The team is polishing the final UI for internal release. Thanh P and Tuan D are taking care of it while Anh T craft the final design. The data pipeline need more work to make Readify more valuable to our team member.

So if it doesnâ€™t work out, we all can blame Huy N.

### Canada intern joins us last week
