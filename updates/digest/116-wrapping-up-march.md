Also, Iâ€™m processing the bonus for our March batch. A shoutout to all for your amazing contribution ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›Â Canâ€™t wait to see more of the likes.

Thanks to your support, Apprenticeship Program is processing a volume of application. Weâ€™ve received more than 30 submissions, not to mention the referral from our team. The hiring squad is working on them.

If your LinkedIn job post receives an applicant, pls help send them the submission form <https://form.typeform.com/to/LfCWfoml> so we can better proceed it.

Bach Khoa Career Fair was a blast last Sunday thanks to Nam, Tom & the Dwarves team for welcoming newbies. Dwarves Discord was able to onboard more than 100 peeps. Discord is getting crowded and letâ€™s hope some of them can be our teammates someday.
