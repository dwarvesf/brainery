Performance Review was wrapped. We're working on the next exciting part, salary adjustment. Those confirmation emails will reach your inbox soon. Apart from this, a side note on your progress will also be attached. It's nice to see both team and individual improvement.

Exposing the team's know-how and discovering more potential Dwarves is one of our next priorities. We'll be hosting two items for 2022

- Apprenticeship Program: Starting in April, Apprenticeship will welcome experienced developers looking for their next career move.
- Tech Monthly Event: Our virtual seminar co-hosting with strong-profile tech speakers. The first will be held by the end of February. Details will be announced to you shortly.
Let's grow the Dwarves Discord.

We welcome Thinh Tran to the dev team this week. A few days ago, he dropped a short intro in #introduction as @chip. Thinh is also one of the first members of our Da Nang team. Glad to have you onboard

Last but not least, this week's Radio Talk is about "A Backend perspective on Engineering in an NFT marketplace", brought to you by Hoang Nguyen.
