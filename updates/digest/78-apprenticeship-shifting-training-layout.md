### Apprenticeship: Shifting training layout

A few weeks have gone by with some training. But there are more to meet the eyes than technical topics.

We’ll be adding more on soft-skills training, starting with Team Communication and Output Deliver Management. Ticket/card tracking during project working is critical, especially it helps removes the roadblock and keeps the info flows smoothly amongst the team.

Hosted by Giang and Ngoc, the training takes place on next Wednesday, June 09. Please reserve your time, and we welcome all the members.

### English-name update

We’ve rolled out a new thing this week. Everyone is turning Basecamp name into English with the convention of English name + Vnese name. Looks interesting, but yeah, it might hard to remember who is who at first.

We’ve help updated the alias email address in company data. However, the email login for Basecamp account needs updated too. Please help to edit it in your Basecamp setting > Personal setting > My profile > Email address, then input your new english email.

Basecamp will then send you an email confirmation for email update ✔️
