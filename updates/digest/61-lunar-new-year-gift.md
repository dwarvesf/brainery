### Lunar new year gift

It’s getting closer to Tet, and we have prepared some gift ready for you. Please help to input your address at <https://bit.ly/3iW73I9> and the recipient name. Some of us have their gift delivered directly to their hometown (yes we support it as well), or have it picked at our new HaDo office.

### Visit the new office

HaDo office is ready to use. We’ve finished moving in the last weekend and set up workspace. Still there are a lot of work to complete, but basically you can pay it a visit at Room I3.18.08 Hà Đô Centrosa. Khai also heads up with some details at this message: HaDo Office.

### Farewell Nghia Pham

Nghia sent his goodbye to us last Friday after nearly 3 years working with the Dwarves. It’s a bit out of nowhere for some of us, but we believe he’s off for a better journey and for that point, we wish him all the best.

### News of the week

Facebook >< Apple: Finally, a legal battle

The simmering battle is about to happen in no time. As claimed, Facebook made its move to sue Tim Cook’s company over their philosophy on data privacy with the belief “this is not as virtuous as its sounds.” At some point, rumor has it that Apple’s move was just about helping its business. Responded to the full-page news ads about how the new feature of iOS 14 may affect the ad business and abusing its market position, Apple’s point was made pretty clear through their latest message of A Day in the Life of Your Data.

From what I believe, as a user, most of us still seems to take Apple’s side because, let’s face it, we all get tired of the unexpected advertising pops up during the scrolling. Technology is supposed to make our life easier, not keeping us up wondering how much we’ve exposed on the socials.
