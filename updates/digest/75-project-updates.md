### News of the week

Google moves to canvas rendering

In terms of prediction, there could be two reasons behind this

- Less painful in supporting multiple browsers: Each browser has different method to display the HTML code. Seeing things in Safari is different from Chrome, obviously. A canvas-based approach gives Google Docs a much more consistent framework to display content. It speeds up the ability to get text, objects, graphs, and images rendered to provide better user experience.
- Support Flutter: Google have already gotten CanvasKit built for Flutter. This move can somehow predicts the future of Google featuring Flutter web
However, changing into canvas-based also change the logic of building UI (how backend used to be structured with specific bits of HTML), which prevents some extension to function as it used to.

Notion rolled out their public API

Notion’s latest rolled out API in beta to better support the development and database management. Formatting things in Notion have been bringing a smooth reading and writing experience, and I believe we all can benefit from it once Notion has allowed us to sync their system with other services. Their detailed changelog can be found here. Hope you find some of them useful
