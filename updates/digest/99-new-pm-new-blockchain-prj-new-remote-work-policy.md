Last Monday, we welcomed a new Project Manager. Along with Khai, he will start to oversee our current project, input his work experience and help us deliver a better standard of project quality. Also, we're happy to onboard a new Backend Lead to help grow the team.

Last Monday, we welcomed Bao Anh as our Project Manager. Along with Khai, he will start to oversee our current project, input his work experience and help us deliver a better standard of project quality. Also, we're happy to onboard Thanh Pham to help grows the team as Backend Lead.

We are onboarding a new blockchain project. It's a management platform for trader portfolio, data analysis and automate trading function based on analyzed data.

The line up team consists of Bao Anh, Minh T & Leo, Khoi N & Huy N, and Quang will take over the current features and set up for data aggregation.

After a few months trial, we all agree to resume the weekly Engineering Meeting sync up. It's more convenient to keep things updated verbally and resolve incidents quicker.

A few Dwarves have started to discover our new office hub. Phat will move to Da Nang office; while Hieu P will take care of the technical setup for our Da Lat Chalet. We'll be providing the Dwarves with Monthly 1-way Ticket to any of our hub. Just ping Han if you're planning to spend your next few months in a different city. Hope this gives us all a new path to blow off some steam from the pandemic.
