Another month has passed. But it feels like April dinner was just yesterday.
Almost all of the Dwarves have finished their health check-up. We'll keep you updated once Diamond gets us the final result; could be in a week or two. Btw, Saigon has been hitting with heavy rain lately, so @peeps, stay safe whenever you head out.

Thanks to @nambui, we got a new template to honor our monthly knowledge contributors.
Let's look at May's hall of fame. No sweat if you're busy and can't attend their talks; we got you covered at Dwarves Youtube: <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_SyzGLf6wiqctQFsRI_frw> and Brainery: <https://brain.d.foundation/>

May All-hands meeting will take place this Friday, June 03 - 5PM. Hope to meet all of you there.
Prolly a team dinner after that, I'm not sure. Let's wait for @thuongptt's msg.
