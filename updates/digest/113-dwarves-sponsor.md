Dwarves Sponsor

Weâ€™re resuming Dwarves Brainery since this March. The model stays the same. You share, we honor.

You can check the submission flow and sponsorship details at #red-alert. Weâ€™ll have a bi-weekly sum up on submission, and sponsorship will be sent at the end of each month.

The program doesnâ€™t limit any role. So invite your friends to join too ðŸ¤™Â  Letâ€™s build this as our learning culture.

Honorary Hall - the first 2 weeks of March

Weâ€™re proud to honor these mates for sharing what they grasp. As you learn and share, we learn as well:

- March 7 Radio Talk: @Lam Nguyen - Develop a C compiler
- Dwarves Brainery: @khacvy - Blockchain Oracle
- Dwarves Brainery: @huyg - Deno & MPA, SPA and Partial Hydration
- March 14 Radio Talk: @lapnn - Monorepo with Turborepo
  Sponsorship for highlight contributions will be sent by the end of each month. And itâ€™s 2 weeks left to see your monthly input. Canâ€™t wait to see more of the likes.

## minigame channel in Discord

Weâ€™ve decided mini events should be a thing to have fun in Discord. After Feb 22 (which Thuong has finsihed sent out those stickers to our winners), 8/3 event is a good one to nominate your woman and send them some good care. The event is still open til March 22, join us now at #minigame ðŸŽ®
