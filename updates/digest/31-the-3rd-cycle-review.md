### End of Cycle Review

Another cycle has come to an end. And that leaves us with many things to proud of. The review session on Friday last for an hour as anh Han walked us through some main points, with all the things we have done and and the gain we have made. Thank you so much for your hard work.

We have also uploaded a detailed note in Woodland>Message Board>Cycle Review. It’s was a long reading, take your time to digest.
