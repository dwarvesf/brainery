Reached the #100 changelog already. Time flies.

Greetings from Da Lat. I'm up here with a few Dwarves. The office is getting redesigned. Seems like we'll be having both inner and outer space. A summer house, I think. Will get you the photos updated as soon as I can. Can't fully describe the renovation progress now, but I can guarantee - the vibe is awesome.

Our weekly 101 session has gradually filled up with more tech topics. We had Quang's topic on k8s 101 and Lam's sharing on Real-time web applications. And this week was a blast: A whole demo showcase on techniques/ practices from the teammates lately.

It's good to see the topics are getting diversified. Thanks for putting the great effort ðŸ‘¾

November All hands meeting is coming, prolly next week. We're coming closer to the end of 2021. Normally, we have a team retreat trip by then. We haven't thought of a detail plan yet, since the pandemic is still happening. In case the trip can't make it - the team will convert this budget into allowance for workstation upgrade. We'll keep you posted ðŸ¤™

And lastly, let's give a warm welcome to
