## Grab your next payment with TransferWise

---

Lunar New Year was like a blink of an eye. We do hope the last 2 weeks was well consumed as you get to spend it with amazing memories âœ¨

Last Thursday marked our first day back to work in 2020. The team has conducted some meetings to resume workload, sync up with team member about the progress and what's next for the game.

### Remote Working Plan Extension ðŸ“¢

We've all heard about the Corona Virus outbreak. As they start to warn us about its dangerous level, which is around eight times higher than SARS-CoV, we would prefer our team to extend the remote working plan up to 15 days. All the details can be found here.

In the meantime, let's just protect our well-being by seriously concern about hygiene and outdoor contacts. And since remote working can sometimes be difficult to sync up and discuss thoroughly about any team issue, we suggest everyone to have a daily stand-up/ check-in, just to make sure your working progress is still doing good.

### TransferWise Account Registration ðŸ’¸

The BoD has just finished the last steps of preparing the Contractor Agreement to ensure your experience in this firm is well taken care. A part of that, is the adoption of TransferWise - a borderless bank account which now will be used for monthly payment. The introduction and instructions are listed here by a.Quang. In this announcement, you may find

- TransferWise registration link: <https://transferwise.com/>
- Submission link for bank detail
- A video for instructions
  Payment through TransferWise will take effect from this month. Please make sure all your bank account detail is updated before Feb 15th, 2020.

### Beta English Course Updates ðŸ“–

Our Operation has come up with some suggestions on English Center that can be fit for the team at the moment: VUS Italk, Aten English and Ecorp English. Each option comes with detail class time, number of class attendant and expected outcome.

You can find the detail info of each program in the comment session of this message. We hope this finds you well.

### Tech Radar Updates ðŸ› 

After the last meeting to brief about Tech Radars, validated the rendered topics and defined what to expect, many teams have uploaded their resources on Google Drive through folders and files.

The definitions of 4 rings on Tech Radar are still worked on, along with the FAQ lists. The topics for Tech Radar were also updated due to the change in resources. Based on the heavy workload after Lunar New Year holiday, 40% of the team might not be able to meet the expected goal. A solution for resolve this and ensure everyone can stay on track with their topics will be discussed by next week.
