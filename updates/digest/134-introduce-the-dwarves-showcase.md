New Merchandise Kit

Last week, we surveyed Dwarves' desire for a new merchandise kit. Several items have received considerable attention. Please support filling out the form (<https://forms.gle/tvD2otNyE78KMc6FA>) and don't hesitate to give your ideas so that we can realize your wishes as soon as possible.

Introduce the Dwarves Showcase

We had the first Friday's Showcase last week - Twitter Tweet Watcher. This event takes place every Friday afternoon to walk everyone through several internal project team demos. The demos will be made brief, entertaining, and easy to consume so that everyone can participate. More information can be found at (<https://bit.ly/3w8N2ps>).

New learning topics

We've resumed adding topics to the ðŸ’¡ãƒ»learning-topics channel, including Metaverse, Event sourcing, etc. Participate in the conversation to learn more and enhance your work.
