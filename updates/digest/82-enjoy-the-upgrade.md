We wrapped up May & June last week. July and August is coming, we have just noted a few updates and main goals for the cycle ahead. Check out the post at Basecamp.

### To the apprentices

We got two topics on air last week

- SQL
- Understanding an Application Design
  The detailed outline & explanation was stored on Outline - our knowledge hub. Meanwhile, Hieu P has created a place for topic requests and presentation slides on team Drive.

Also, we have received some contributions for our Second Brain on Discord/programming. Vincenzo Vy Tran has uploaded his research on Micro Frontend Development. Check out his great work; we’ve had it on team memo as well. 👀

### Office item shipment

We’ve finished processing the request. The ordered items are on their way. Please help to check on your phone for the upcoming deliveries. Due to COVID, some items might take longer days for shipment.

We hope to have your patience on it. I also create a thread on Twitter. Please drop your received item in above thread. Would love to have a look at your new setup 🙆🏻‍♀️

That's all for the past week. Enjoy the upgrade and stay safe.
