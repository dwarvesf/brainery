### Biz Update


### Team and Quality

Project Artifacts Progress

Khai has come up with the artifacts list, and we'll start taking it as the proof of deliverables once any project is wrapped up.

Some projects are still backed up on Drive, as we plan to auto clone the source git and drive back into the compliance list. We might need to set up a workflow based on these practices and apply it to all the current projects. Plus, team velocity is also a thing weâ€™ll need to work on and distribute more equally if possible.

Apprenticeship Update

We're having 3 more Apprentices onboarded this week, increasing the current Apprenticeship team number to 6. The training session has been kicked off led by Huy, Thanh & Hieu P. We also gave a brief explanation our current gitflow for the newbies through a short Radio Talk.

Testlink for QC standard

QC Team is applying Testlink - a web-based test management tool to better oversee the test cases as it supports testers with finetuned and visualized reports with charts and metrics.

We're shifting the hiring for Test Engineer as well.

### Holiday Off Heads-up

We'll be taking day-offs in the next two weeks, which precisely is:

- Hung Kings Commemoration Day:
- Liberation Day & International Workers' Day:
It's been a while since our last holiday. May you all have a great time to recharge and spend good moments with the fam.

### Communication

The 1st draft of Obvs

Obvs - our newsletter that provides startups and business insights has just released its first issue at Obvs: Well, this just happened.

The agenda is broken down into sections: Investment (ofc), Business & Finance, Tech Space, Design Space and Event lists.

### News recap

M$ <> Nuance

Previously this week, Microsoft announced to acquire Nuance Communication - a leader in speech-to-text for $19.7B. The acquisition represents the latest step in Microsoft's industry-specific cloud strategy - Healthcare.

One of Nuance's most popular products includes Dragon Ambient Experience, which involved speech recognition, chatbots, and natural language processing, particularly in healthcare and other verticals. It is believed that leveraging Nuance's cutting-edge conversational AI technology and the firm foundation of cloud-based solutions of M$, this collaboration between the two offers the next level of healthcare services. As they agreed: "AI has so far been the top priority in tech, and healthcare is the most critical application that needs to be focused on."

What can we benefit from GitHub Action

It's been a year since the first release of GitHub CLI. Coming back this time with two top-level commands: gh run and gh workflow, the support from GitHub Actions allows developers to stay on top of workflow runs and work directly with them from the terminal.
