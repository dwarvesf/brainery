### Apprenticeship Program

We’re getting back on Apprenticeship this year. Huy is in charge of running the campaign. Apprenticeship is designed for engineers with working experience, but they seek to fill up the foundation knowledge, or simply want to improve themself. Hope we can bring a few more people to expand the team.

### Annual Health Care reminder

Just a quick reminder. We’re having the annual health check up next week, starting with the blood test on Monday, March 13th. The overall health check up will take place on Saturday, March 20th. Please be reminded that the blood test will be conducted at our office. Check out this message again if you seek for more detailed info.

### News recap

GitHub CLI

Github CLI isn’t a new thing for us, but this feature is. Github CLI now allows user to create the alias script, and by that, makes thing faster for us to type in and run the command. This helps reduce the time for scripting, as the alias can be defined and remembered for us. With its API, this can access anything and combine easily with other tools as well.

Write simply

How Paul Graham describe his writing prompts, easy word and to the point. As he said: The ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words that got them there. Unless you’re applying for a scholarship, don’t use big words. It removes the effort for them to search for the definition, and reduce your time to create a well-done draft. When you write in a fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just so you can seem cool. It doesn’t have to be this hard. Writing in simple word doesn’t make you become amateur. It means you care about the reader to explain the problem as simple as you could.

Online recipe in Git

Nothing tech-related I just feel mắc cười when a recipe site is created simply without any ads with a Github. May you find some easy cooking guide in this open-source repo
