Hope you got a good weekend. In fact, most holidays happen to be on the weekend this year - 2022 is kinda promising I suppose ðŸ‘€

Updates, December All-hands meeting will take place this Friday, Jan 07 - 5PM. Look forward to meeting all of you there.

DOTY form has officially closed, and prize items are being prepared. Both the prize and the winner list increased this year - The result will be announced during All-hands.
Besides the prize list for winners, Iâ€™ve also got a prize combo for all of the Dwarves. You guys really rocked 2021, and I wanna thank that.
