and yes, team retreat on next Friday. We also look forward to announcing our Dwarves of 2020 ✔️

### News of the week

Apple's move on creating wireless chargers

Apple has just finished filing the latest design patents for its next move. Particularly, wireless charger on Macbook for smaller Apple devices.

The palm rest area gets utilized once Apple decides to turn those into chargers. But the game doesn't stop there. The second patent includes a design where all the Macbook lid becomes the charging area. Users are no longer struggle to find a charger plug. And yes, thanks to the wide cover, more than one device is welcomed.
