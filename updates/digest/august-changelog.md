Project Compliance

To build a more professional presence, it must come from the team inside. We did a completely Audit Session from project team to quality shipment.

- Reaction feedback icon: That mini section under every weekly changelog. As the client starts to test them, it give us hype and heart-attack at the same time ü•≤
- Project audit: A full cycle from technical to management audit to grab the team's understanding on projects on a higher level than merely coding. By doing this, we're able to uncover new opportunities that benefits the products and businesses.
- Case study feature: The long streak of case study crafting journey. All air at memo.d.foundation in case study hashtag.

### Team Growth

Into the Blockchain world

We're advancing fast on Blockchain. console.so was built as our blockchain lab with NFT projects and blockchain-based activities.

With this, the number of Dwarves who could write smart contracts has increased recently. The team starts to equip themselves with blockchain insights & technical grasp.

You are encouraged to do so. To search for help, I think Huy, Phuc, Tay & Quang are the ones you need.

Dwarves Brainery

Through 2 pools, the team brain got escalated. Our brainery has official launched at brain.d.foundation, in which the team's work are arranged into ‚Ñ¶Fleeting notes & ‚Ñ¶Literature notes.

Road to a more diversified knowledge area.

Level up LinkedIn profiles

Building a professional team interface to let the world knows there're more of us than just the lines of code. A creditable team is made from impactful teammates.

We move towards automation. Having things automated helps us focus more on the real work.

For the last 2 months, Nam has been head over heels on his V-model automation testing framework. That left him with the demo last Friday, which transpired with success.

Upsert flow for audience db

We're growing the audience community. The Fortress team has uplifted the workload by creating an upsert flow. This auto-upsert mechanism logs all contacts from our social channels, puts them into our Notion db for further team publication: Dwarves Updates, Dwarves Feedback & Turing Alley.
