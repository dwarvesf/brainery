### Engage to earn boost

Our Discord has just announced the latest move - resuming the #starboard.

From now on, @peeps can vote :star: on your fav article. Every article receiving more than 2 :star: will be listed on #starboard. Peeps who make it to the starboard will get awesome rewards from Dwarves.

For your sharing to be eligible, you will need to include a summary note with it. Hope to see more of the stars!

### Performance review

Have y’all done your self-review yet? Clock is ticking @peeps. Anyways, @thuongptt has rolled out the peer review forms through your Dwarves email, please submit it together with your self-review before June 15.

In case you have any questions, ping @thanh or @thuongptt in advance.

### Shipping out June Brainery reward
