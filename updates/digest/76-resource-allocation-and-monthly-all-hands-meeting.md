### Apprenticeship training status

Last week Apprenticeship training credit went to Hieu P with his explanation on Applying basic DevOps into coding process. The detailed slide is stored on team Drive/ DevOpsbasic. We hope all the apprentices can find that beneficial.

### #Monthly All-hands Meeting

Instead of cycle meeting once every two month, we’ll be conducting all hands meeting monthly (and virtually I suppose), starting from May. We believe this could help hot fix the issue during the month, and quickly come up with resolution if necessary.

May’s all-hands meeting will take place next Friday, May 28th. Please reserve your time. We’ll see you all in donut, or taco.

### News of the week

Programming fundamentals

A point of view for the critical of programming fundamentals. Speaking from a developer who has been standing on both sides of the debate: the practical aspect and the solid foundation of programming. He stated out why the fundamentals offers a bigger context and provides us with multiple options for resolution.

New release: Sublime Text 4

The latest version of Sublime Text has just been rolled out and received many good feedback on HN. Sublime Test has a history of lightweight setup and far ahead in terms of performance. Thought there has been many alternatives such as VSCode, Sublime Text remains as a long-live option for developers since 2012. Its 4 version also supports M1 as well, a good news for Mac users.
