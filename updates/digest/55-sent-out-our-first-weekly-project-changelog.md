### Weekly Project Changelog

As mentioned in those previous (and lmao I hope you all read), weâ€™re starting to send out our weekly changelog for each project. We hope this marks an attempt for better collaboration, and the client gets a greater view on how work happened within the week.

Still, the tooling for a neat format email compose is a bit hard to find. Itâ€™ll be great if you can suggest us with some ideas. Weâ€™ve had Stripo, Drip and Moonmail for testing but none of them seems good enough.

### Team Website

First of all we would like to deliver our greatest thank to all for spending your time coming to block B, which, some of you are obviously working full-time remote. The photos have been forwarded to Anh, as sheâ€™ll give it some last touches and make sure weâ€™ll end up with a better visual for d.foundation/team.

### New Project

Quod.ai

Our latest project which focuses on enable high performing engineering teams by providing them the real-time necessary code. Hieu Vu is kick starting his work with the team.

WeUp

We resume our work with our client loyalty app. The line up team for development would be 2FE (Cuong & Vy); 2 Mobiles (Trung & Phuc, ofc); 2BE (An D & Khoi N), while Thanh D will take care of the designing part.

Weâ€™re still looking for more Android resources, a few extra hands will help. Meanwhile, Minh L will mainly take care of this temporarily.

WeGo

WeGo has finally come to the development stage, as Anh has finished working on the stunning design for its website and order flow. Thanh P will take over the FE development first thing next week.

### News of the week

FB vs Apple

This undoubtedly is what has been covering most internet news lately. Users like us must have gone through the feeling of being advertised by Facebook, more than once. Sometimes it even gives us goosebump since the product was only mentioned like second earlier. Donâ€™t know about you, but yeah Iâ€™d prefer to know what type of info is being exploited. Like, I know I was talking about a house., but that doesn't mean I can afford it hello ðŸ™ƒ
