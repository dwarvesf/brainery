A small reminder: November All-hands Meeting is coming this Friday, December 02.

Please reserve your schedule from 5:30 PM. We'll be walking through some projects and team updates, and the progress of our new getaway offices.

Lastly, just paid Da Nang Office a short visit. A small hub filled with trees & light. With every room comes with a balcony, I believe it should be great for a short getaway trip out of town.

The whole place is still under some last touches, and interior will be setup afterwards. Anyhoo, here are a few thru my lens.

Da Nang team is looking for teammate. The 1-way ticket policy will soon to be applicable. Just ping a.Bao if you plan to move here for a while ✈️
