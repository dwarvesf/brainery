Hey there @peeps. Did everyone have a retreat weekend? Another highlight of Monday Changelog will reflect on everything we've accomplished just over the week!

Tech Radar

Starting in 2020, Tech Radar is a place for our engineers to trial and evaluate emerging technologies, then set the direction for Dwarves’ tech stack.

Tech Radar Volume 4 will continue with Elixir, Artificial intelligence, Testing, Experimentation and Automation.
