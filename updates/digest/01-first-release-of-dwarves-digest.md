### The Next Cycle: 2019 Wrapping Up

A sum up post of the goals we're reaching in late November and December. Written by our CEO, the post outlined our latest projects which include: Culture Book, Ops Automation, Website Upgrades and others. We expect to wrap the resolution before hitting 2020, and we'd love to receive all of your support!

Find out more here.

### Canada Branch: Finished Business Registration

As many of you know, we're launching a new office in Canada. Our Boards have finished the stage of business registration and moving on to the next steps. Leveraging the immigration policy and local resources are what Linh - our Head of Sale is focusing on. Looking forward to the great news.

### Dwarves of The Year 2019

The annual employee award program that recognizes and rewards our Dwarves's hard work. The voting poll has been conducted for 2 weeks and expected to come to the stage of data assessment.

If you haven't submitted your thoughts, and you have about 2 mins before grabbing your snack, well, can we have your vote here?

### Employee Stock Ownership Plan

In most companies, employee ownership is less common. We are different and we want to use this to support our culture, where all employees together own a substantial stake and have a meaningful voice. We want you to co-own this company.
Have a check at our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and reach back to our board members should you have any questions.

### 2019 Internship Video Recap

A great product from the team to capture the valuable moments from our Spring 2019 Internship. The video also available on our Youtube channel - your view(s) will actually help level up the brand awareness! Cheers!

### English Class

Since the last engineering team meeting, we have decided to conduct the Technical English Class. The Beta Course is made as a trial for leader's level, and is expected to last for 1.5 months. After that time, we will base on the result and fix the teaching material for the junior engineers.

We know there are a lot of things to improve, and we'd love to have your participation on it. Make sure you can get the best out of it.

### November Engineering Meeting

Last Friday was the last friday of November, which means we have just gone through another Engineering Meeting. The meeting covered from the latest project updates, team status updates the feedback from our customers and the planning for upcoming goals.

Our VP of Engineering has summed up the meeting minutes here. We hope it finds you well and be fully aware of what needs to be maintained, or improved.

### Dwarves Website

dwarves.foundation is how we communicate and tell our story to the world. Lately, our website team has worked collaboratively and successfully launched these new pages:

- Blog: The Dwarves Crafting Diary - where we store the documented knowledge
- Playbook: our best practices towards the way we work

There are also News - for the up-to-date information we wish to share externally; and Article - the tailored place we use to describe the values we live by.

### Content Pipeline

We know it's hard for you to keep checking up the Activity section in Basecamp to catch up with the team, but at some point you'll feel being left out. That sucks! Weekly Digest is the tool we're creating to make sure everyone stays abreast of the news, and Content Pipeline is layering the first bricks.
Should you feel the urge to help us make it happen, ping Duy for more info. We welcome all the support!
