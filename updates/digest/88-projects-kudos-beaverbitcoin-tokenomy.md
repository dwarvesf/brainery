### Project kudos

Good words earlier last week from the clients. I would like to give a big congrats our two teams working on Blockchain projects. Shout out Nikki, Hien, Khai, Huyen, Vy and Khanh. Please keep the good work coming ðŸ™Œ

### Project compliance

Han did a quick non-technical audit with Hieu, An and Bien for their project. The dev team got full aware of project charter, direction and milestones. For next month session, please translate them into diagrams and notes.

### Workflow update: V-model approach

V-model is an approach to make the collaboration between dev and tester more efficient. Nam has finished mapping the V-model approach testing flow. He is applying it to a blockchain project. He'll be giving a presentation to the project heads later this week.
