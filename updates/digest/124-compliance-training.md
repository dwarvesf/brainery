### Training Workshop: Software Modeling Class

- After the successful trial run with anh Ngô Ngọc Đăng Khoa, lecturer at University of Science HCM, we will try to invite more lecturers at universities to participate in the training so @peeps know how to get things done properly so please mark the date if you want to attend: Tue, June 14 from 7:30PM to 9PM
- Let us know if there are any topics you’re interested in learning, we’re gonna make it happen. And please share your feedback on last Tuesday class through this 5-min survey: <https://form.typeform.com/to/HORIJBDe>

### June Braniery Input

As in our May All Hands Meeting, the team is moving along with blockchain, this week we have these cool brainery submissions related:

- Useeffect double call in React 18 <https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/25> by @namth
- How token works in Solana <https://github.com/dwarvesf/brain/pull/24> by @khacvytran
  Open to everyone, feel free to submit your input. We have rewards for every qualified submission.

Don’t know how to? Don’t worry @thuongptt will publish a guideline next week. Stay tuned, @peeps

In last Thursday, we have @k2 with his sharing about the concept of Soulbound: what it is for, how it works and its future possibilities. Be prepared, @peeps cause you will soon get to experiment with it through some internal projects.
