Business Direction doesn't change much from last month. We're still place our focus on blockchain-based deals and expand the team with more experience in this field of tech.

### New Deals in Town

- Blockchain-based project that creates customized tools for professional traders.
- Cross-chain exchanged platform and NFT marketplace. Another highlight ? We got Lufty back on this!
  We're stretching the office hubs. The chalet in DaLat is getting reconstructed; while Phat N & Hieu P are setting up to welcome the first nomads to Da Nang place. We're heading for a squad of 15-25 teammates there. Tech Meetup and Training will be hosted here next year, that's the plan.

### New Member

Proud to announce some updates in project member

- Truong Nguyen have successfully onboarded as Android Engineer & QC Engineer
- Thanh Pham joined us as Blockchain Engineer
- Kieu Huy joined us as a part-time Blockchain Engineer
- Khanh Phan joined us as Visual Designer
  Warmly welcome y'all!

### Highlight Team Effort

Many presentation and demos have been showcased in our 101 Monday Training lately. I want to thank you all for making it an engineering culture. We learn, share, adopt and repeat.

### Resume Engineering Meeting

New team leads and old team leads have sit to get to know each other. However, we'll need a more organized structure for this - instead of ad-hoc meeting & status update. The focus will be to answer the questions:

- What: is the product roadmap? Can our engineers and our team have long-term benefits from it?
- How: do we deliver? Are our work quality good/bad? Is there any room for improvements?
- Who: are doing well in your team? Who are doing not well? What should we do to make everyone more productive?

### How 1:1 Meeting is Going On

The team is getting better in doing 1:1. Thanh has started the 1:1 skip-level meetings to understand more about other members and their perspectives.

## IN THE TEAM

### Hiring Pipeline Revamp

We'll be using Notion for the full hiring flow. Team leads will involve more into the hiring process. Their POVs and expertise would help us finding the right members

### Dwarves of The Year Setup

It's about time for DOTY. Voting form will be open from the middle of Dec ‚úåÔ∏è

### Moving things to Discord

Discord will be our next handout place. We'll start to public the team demos here as well.

Please be well-noted: All the project/ workflow/ useful techniques demo comes with reward üòé¬†This is also a part of the Engage to Earn Model which Nam has been working on lately.
