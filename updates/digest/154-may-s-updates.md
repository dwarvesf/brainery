🏆 #2: LLM in Production

@Tom @ngocthanh @khacvy @quang successfully picked up critical techniques for building up apps on top of LLM.

- Optimizing token usage in chatbot message history by implementing a vector database to save history and contacts, relying on GPTs and finding related message histories.
- Developing a chatbot capable of summarizing information by encoding questions into vectors and searching for similar vectors within our database.
  Hopefully once words get out, we will get to use these new skills and techniques to solve new problems for our clients kkk.

🏆 #3: Dwarves Bounties

The route is simple: pick a bounty, work with us, deliver, and get rewarded $icy. Through earning bounties, community members have a chance to bond and experience the Dwarves vibe.

In May alone, 1k7 ICY (~ $2k5) was rewarded for Dwarves and community members who participated.

Sit tight, more bounties are coming soon at <https://earn.d.foundation/>.

🏆 #4: Community Building

While online tech events have been our forte, we took it to the next level with offline events. May saw us partner with various tech communities and various guests from outside of Dwarves.

It's encouraging to see our members actively contribute to sharing their knowledge through these events too! Big thanks to

🏆 #5: Speeding up onboarding process

Onboarding now has become faster and more effective. In May, we applied the new onboarding process for both new team members and community members working on bounties.

- Practical work instead of too much theory
- Get hands-on with the newbies from the beginning
- Goal is to ship something within the first week
  These changes seems to be working. New members seem to get started with a much, much better motivation and state of mind.

🏆 #6: Additionally we're celebrating:

- @n took the reign with building up Fortress. Ops work would suck without your help
- @lapnn started his leading responsibilities for Plot project.
- @DarthCastelian is our advocate, he intro-ed potential clients to us.
- @hnh @minhlq @minhth supercharged our server's bot.
- @khacvy was super active with community building activities.
