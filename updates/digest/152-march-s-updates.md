1/ Exciting client update!

Our partner is fundraising. If everything goes according to plan, they will have more budget to invest in tech. This means we can expect to expand the team and bringing fresh talents.

2/ Tech events going public

We have monthly tech events, as everyone already knows. Now instead of keeping it to ourselves, we're bringing in external forces i.g partners, speakers... to share more of what we're great at, and also to learn from others in the industry.

Last night's event was a blast, with 6 partners, 6 speakers, and over 140 attendees coming together. Thank you @innno\_ @vitran @Tom @nambui for grinding hard to make it happen.

3/ LightningCon 2023

Bitcoin VN teamed up for the first Lightning Network Conference in Asia. <https://lightningcon.org/>. If you're in Danang and want to come, ping us. We can get you free tickets.

That's all for last week, happy coding.
