# 146 - Congrats DOTY and Win of The Year 2022

Howdy y’all. It's been a long road to get back to a normal routine after the Dwarves’ Year End Party last Friday. We'd like to thank all our @peeps and @newbie who joined us for the night. We had a blast and hope you did too.

We were thrilled to announce DOTY and Win of the Year 2022 at the final. Honored for all the hard work & you guys nailed it in 2022! We have a long run of awesome to look forward.
