One day left for 8/3 vote

Last day to nominate your beloved woman. We’ll wrap up the event by the end of 22/3 and send out the gift package real soon.

Ideas for new merchandise combo

I’m thinking of T-shirts, masks and maybe some crocs sandals. You know, something that takes us only 5 mins to be ready and get out of the house. Just ping me if you got anything in mind. I’m up for any suggestions.
