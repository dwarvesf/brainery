Hello folks, just wanted to wish you a warm welcome back from your vacation. Those discord channels are still bursting at the seams with activity.

First reward batch for team brain contributor
The transitory notes have been collected, entered into the brain repository, and converted into contributor rewards. It's encouraging to see the initial step taken. We'll return with the next pool, and we expect to see more of the same in the future.

Bao Minh Insurance Card Pick-up
The insurance card has been picked up. You can pick up yours at the HaDo office or have it delivered to your home by pinging me or @itsmia.

New Dwarves in town
It's great to have some new faces to add to the team. They'll be working with us as Data and Fullstack Engineers on projects. Greetings and welcome onboard @jmsong84 & @Dung Ho.
