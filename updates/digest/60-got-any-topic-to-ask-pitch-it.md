### Pitch your next Topic

Tri, like other newbies, got a bit confused distinguishing us with other outsources companies. We brought the #2 episode of Radio talk with “Startup”, through the point of view from Minh, Tay, Khai & Giang. The full recap can be found at Dwarves Memo: Startup.

Submit your turn at <https://bit.ly/3c34zpW>. We’ll get back every Monday at 5pm.

### Radar Update

We synced up last Friday to assess all the topics from radar-vol02. Some upcoming trials were agreed on.

- Volta: A JS management tool to replace nvm and tj/n. Thanh has applied this lately for his projects as he realized it upgraded developer’s experience onto a new level. Minh T will take it as his next trial for BaseHQ as well.
- Earthly & Upptime: These two reduce the time for server setup. After trying with smaller scopes, Quang has decided to use it on other projects, as he hopes it could be a part of our project toolkit in the future.
- Webflow: A no-code platform that turns design into product without coding techniques. The team has raised some issues using this, and listed out some alternatives with the same function. We believe Webflow needs more comparison and assessment before adopting this to everyone.
- Domain Insight Research: Every two weeks, Khai & Ly will share the experience after applying this research framework on different domains. Hopefully those talks are helpful to anyone who firstly pickup a new domain.

### Moving to HaDo

Since we’re closing down blockB, the Dwarves will need to work from home until HaDo office goes official. Khai will help to announce once the day is confirmed, but we expect it to be the beginning of February.

Meanwhile, please collect your items at blockB this weekend, otherwise it might get difficult to find yours once they are packed and moved to the new office.

### Annual Healthcare

As announced, our 2021 annual healthcare will take place after Tet Holiday. The estimated timeline falls for the third week of March (from 15/03). All the Dwarves will have their blood tested at the office before heading for other checkups. We’ll be using Vigor’s Healthcare service.

You may find the details of the program at this message. If you’re not able to be at Saigon at the time, give Van a heads-up.

### News of the Week

New Mac-Book Pro Models to Flat-Edged Design

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has lately announced the company’s next move on revamping the MacBook Pro’s design. As Kuo claimed, “It’ll be not much different from holding an iPhone 12 in

14 and 16-inch size options”. This designed is also promised to have more additional USB-C ports, as user no longer need to purchase dongle for ports supplement.

The new social without Trump

As Trump’s account has been banned from Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and other platforms, social media user’s may witnessed the platforms without this man being omnipresent. As someone who was portrayed as a paragon of casual bigotry in the media, the new Internet without Trump may lessen the number of online discourse, and yes, meme and GIFs afterwards.
