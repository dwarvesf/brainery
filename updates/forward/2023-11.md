Rust, the programming language, has been on our radar for quite some time, primarily in the context of developing compiler tooling – a niche that sparked only modest interest within our team. However, our perspective shifted significantly after engaging in [a community project](https://github.com/webuild-community/spacebot) aimed at creating a Rust-based game server. This experience opened our eyes to Rust's impressive capabilities. Our developers have come to greatly appreciate the language's speed, safety, and performance.

Furthermore, we've observed that Rust continues to evolve, increasingly supporting a wider array of applications, notably in web development and artificial intelligence. This evolution has motivated us to delve deeper into the language. Our initial steps involve comprehending Rust's concurrency model, which is pivotal for our community project. Simultaneously, we are eager to explore new facets of Rust, expanding our understanding and application of this powerful language.

In the present fast-moving business world, both startups and established enterprises are tasked with the rapid development and maintenance of multiple web applications. Despite the availability of numerous mature UI libraries, there is a persistent demand for UI solutions tailored to specific organizational needs. Through our extensive client work, we have created several unique UI packages. Recognizing the value of these developments, we are now transitioning towards creating our own [open-source UI library](https://github.com/consolelabs/web-foundation), specifically designed for building our internal applications.

This move towards an open-source framework, however, presents a distinct set of challenges compared to closed-source development. Essential factors such as comprehensive documentation, efficient release workflows, and modular design for tree-shaking components require careful consideration. Our journey has been rich with lessons learned, which we are eager to transform into best practices for both our team and the wider community.

Parallel processing is a computing technique that enables multiple streams of calculations or data processing tasks to occur concurrently through numerous central processing units (CPUs) working together. It is commonly used in scenarios where complex tasks and computations need to be performed, and it offers several advantages in various fields, including manufacturing and data processing.

We’ve also recently demoed the benefits of parallel processing in one of our DuckDB demos, that includes processing in parallel dozens of parquet files over HTTPFS (150mb each) and using a map-reduce style to output a taxi trip visual report in seconds.
