> **Reflection** ties everything together with our overarching thoughts or a bold prediction. This is where we step back, reflect on the issue’s themes, and freely share what we think, looking ahead to what’s next.

This month’s research cycle reinforced one thing: the ground beneath software engineering is shifting fast. The rise of agentic tools, programmable in natural language and powered by open-source frameworks, is making it easier to experiment but harder to predict where the craft is heading. We’re seeing a decade of agents, not just a year, and that means our best bet is to stay curious, keep experimenting, and challenge our assumptions about what “building software” really means.
