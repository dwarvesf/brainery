## Our Narratives (N subsection)

> **Tech narratives** focus on the big trends in the dev and tech community, exploring how they shape the way we build software. This is where we dig into what窶冱 driving change and what it means for our work as craftspeople. For instance, in our [May 2025 issue](/updates/forward/2025-05), we explored how AI is changing software development, a trend we see growing stronger.

Qs to ask ourselves know-how qs
we try to answer all the questions

- how to code with agent
- how to grow in age of intelligence
- how to navigate changes
- what is a great dev shop
- what make us sustain

AI agents and agentic workflows dominated our conversations this month. The line between traditional software and AI-driven systems blurred further, with discussions centering on how LLMs, new programming languages, and orchestration frameworks are reshaping what it means to build and maintain software.

- **AI agents vs. agentic AI:**  
    A foundational read from arXiv mapped out the distinction between AI agents (modular, task-driven systems) and agentic AI (systems with higher autonomy and initiative). This taxonomy sparked internal debate about how much autonomy we should actually hand over to our tools.

- **Software 1.0, 2.0, 3.0:**  
    Andrej Karpathy窶冱 keynote reframed how we see programming: from hand-written code (1.0), to neural nets (2.0), to LLMs programmable by natural language (3.0). This lens is shaping how we evaluate new tools and workflows.

- **Cultural context in consulting:**  
    A practical breakdown of how cultural differences affect client relationships, from directness in communication to decision-making styles. This insight is already influencing how we scope and deliver projects for global clients.

- **Agent frameworks on the rise:**  
    New open-source projects are lowering the barrier to building and deploying AI agents. Notable mentions include [Mochiﾂ竊余(https://github.com/mochilang/mochi), [AutoAgentﾂ竊余(https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent), and [Gemini CLIﾂ竊余(https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). These tools promise faster iteration and more autonomy for software systems.
- **Vector databases in focus:**  
    The debate over Pinecone, Weaviate, and Milvus highlighted the tradeoffs between performance, cost, and openness in managing embeddings at scale. Community feedback raised concerns about Pinecone窶冱 closed-source model and pricing, nudging us to keep alternatives on our radar.

- **Agentic coding companions:**  
    Tools like [Fridayﾂ竊余(https://www.codewithfriday.com/) and [Claudiaﾂ竊余(https://claudia.asterisk.so/) are pushing the boundaries of what AI can automate in the dev workflow, from PR automation to session management.
