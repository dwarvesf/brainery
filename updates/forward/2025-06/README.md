## Welcome to forward engineering

Welcome to our monthly snapshot of what's happening at Dwarves. We're excited to share this June 2025 edition with you, packed with insights from our latest experiments, discoveries, and honest takes on where tech is heading.

Forward engineering is how we keep our team sharp and connected. Each month, we gather the best of what we've learned through building, testing, and exploring the tech landscape. It's our way of staying ahead together while sharing the journey with our woodland community.

Consider this your invitation to join us as we navigate the changing world of software craftsmanship. We're not just observers, we're active participants, and we want you along for the ride.

## How we put this together

We're glad you asked. Our process has evolved to make every issue worth your time. We start by diving into what's actually happening in tech, not just the headlines. Then we build our own understanding through hands-on experiments and real client work.

Some months we focus on emerging tools we've tested. Other times we explore bigger trends that are reshaping how we build software. The common thread? Everything we share comes from genuine experience and curiosity about what's next.

If you're curious about the full process behind these issues, we've documented everything in our [research guide on composing newsletters](https://memo.d.foundation/research/compose). It's a behind-the-scenes look at how we turn observations into insights you can actually use.

## What's new in this format

We're trying something different with this June issue, and we hope you'll enjoy the changes. The structure feels more connected now, with each section building naturally to the next. We've sharpened our focus on practical experiments and real findings rather than abstract concepts.

Here's how it flows: we start with what's happening at Dwarves right now, explore the big trends shaping our work, spot new opportunities on the horizon, share tools we've actually put through their paces, point you to external resources worth your time, and wrap up with our honest thoughts on what it all means.

Think of it as a guided tour through our month of discovery.

## Your roadmap for this issue

We've organized everything to make your reading experience smooth and engaging. Here's what awaits you:

**[Overview](01-overview.md)** - Jump in here for a quick snapshot of our latest deliverables, team updates, and research directions. It's your starting point for understanding where we've been focusing our energy.

**[Tech narratives](02-narrative.md)** - Come along as we explore agent-first development and agentic workflows. We're seeing the lines blur between traditional software and AI-driven systems, and we want to share what that means for all of us.

**[Market pulses](03-pulse.md)** - Discover the early signals we're tracking, from AI orchestration layers to how AI products are approaching SEO. These are the movements that might become tomorrow's big shifts.

**[Tech radar](04-radar.md)** - See what we've actually tested this month. From DSPy and Claude Code to Swift 6 concurrency and our experiments with vibe coding, these are tools and frameworks we've put through real trials.

**[Misc finds](05-misc.md)** - Browse our collection of external resources that caught our attention and added value to our thinking. Sometimes the best insights come from outside our usual circles.

**[Reflection](06-reflection.md)** - Join us as we step back and share our honest take on this month's themes. This is where we connect the dots and look ahead to what's coming next.

**[Wrap up](07-wrap.md)** - Meet the Dwarves who made this issue happen. We believe in recognizing the people who push our understanding forward and make these insights possible.

Welcome aboard. Let's explore what June taught us about building software in an age of intelligence.
