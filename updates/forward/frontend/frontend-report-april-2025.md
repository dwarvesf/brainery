## React

### [React.memo Demystified: When It Helps and When It Hurts](https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-memo-when-it-helps-when-it-hurts/)

React's memoization tools like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` cache values or components and prevent unnecessary re-renders based on dependency changes. A common misconception is addressed that memoizing props alone doesn't prevent child component re-renders, but rather when the prop is used in a hook or the child is wrapped with `React.memo`. There are also a few common pitfalls to watch out for, like prop spreading, the children prop, and nested memo components that can silently break memoization.

### [JSX Over The Wire: Rethinking API design with Server Components](https://overreacted.io/jsx-over-the-wire/)

Forget traditional REST APIs - React Server Components enable returning UI components as JSON directly. This approach links prop-generating code with prop-consuming code through composable ViewModels, creating self-contained UI pieces that handle their own data dependencies. The result? Components rendered in a single client-server roundtrip while maintaining client-side state. This paradigm shift could radically transform how we architect React applications, blurring the line between API and UI.

### [React Reconciliation: The Hidden Engine Behind Your Components](https://cekrem.github.io/posts/react-reconciliation-deep-dive/)

Ever wonder how React actually updates the DOM? This deep dive reveals how React's reconciliation engine compares element trees to determine minimal updates. Component identity is primarily determined by element type and position, though the key prop can override this behavior to preserve state across renders. The article provides practical performance tips including state colocation, avoiding inline component definitions, and designing with clear component boundaries - essential knowledge for optimizing React apps at scale.

## Next.js

### [Next.js 15.3: Turbopack builds have arrived](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-3)

The wait is over! Next.js 15.3 delivers Turbopack builds in alpha that are a staggering 60% faster than Webpack on 16-core machines. Not ready for Turbo? The release also introduces a community-built Rspack plugin with near-perfect Webpack API compatibility. Enhanced navigation control comes through new `onNavigate` and `useLinkStatus` APIs, plus a new client instrumentation file lets you set up monitoring before your app even starts. This is the performance breakthrough Next.js developers have been waiting for.

### [Migrating Grep from Create React App to Next.js: 70% faster FCP](https://vercel.com/blog/migrating-grep-from-create-react-app-to-next-js)

When Vercel migrated Grep (a code search tool) from Create React App to Next.js, the results were transformative. Search became faster, UI smoother, and mobile performance drastically improved. The secret sauce? React Server Components and Partial Prerendering cut First Contentful Paint by a whopping 70%. This real-world case study demonstrates the tangible benefits of modern rendering approaches for applications with complex search functionality.

### [Next.js Deployment Challenges: Why platforms need better open source collaboration](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-we-run-nextjs/)

Netlify reveals the uncomfortable truth about supporting Next.js outside Vercel's ecosystem. Unlike other frameworks, Next.js lacks an adapter mechanism, forcing platforms like Netlify to reverse-engineer Vercel's private build output format. This creates maintenance burdens and limits community contributions. Published before Vercel's RFC for the Deployment API, this article highlights the urgent need for greater transparency, open standards, and a clearer roadmap for the entire Next.js ecosystem.

### [Migrating 3.7 Million Lines of Flow Code to TypeScript](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/migrating-3-7-million-lines-of-flow-code-to-typescript-8a836c88fea5)

Pinterest successfully migrated 3.7 million lines of code from Flow to TypeScript over eight months. The migration used a "big bang" approach using codemods and had three phases: setup, conversion, and integration. Pinterest validated the migration through detailed testing, including daily automated tests, manual testing, and byte-for-byte comparisons of transpiled JavaScript.

### [Astro 5.7: Native SVG Components and Font Optimization](https://astro.build/blog/astro-570/)

Astro's latest release delivers three powerful additions to this increasingly popular framework. The Experimental Fonts API brings painless integration and optimization of fonts from various providers. The now-stable Sessions API enables secure server-side storage of user data with type-safety and flexible storage options. Perhaps most exciting, SVG components are now natively supported, allowing direct import and use of SVG files as components within Astro projects - simplifying your workflow for graphics-rich applications.

### [Is Vite faster than Turbopack? Real-world performance comparison](https://www.kylegill.com/essays/vite-vs-turbopack)

The build tool wars continue! Real-world tests comparing Next.js (Webpack & Turbopack) versus Vite (Rollup & Rolldown) reveal fascinating performance differences. Vite dominates in cold starts and page navigation scenarios, while Turbopack excels in Fast Refresh and Hard Refresh situations. Webpack consistently trails as the slowest option. These benchmarks provide valuable insights for teams making crucial tooling decisions that impact developer experience across projects.

TanStack Router is about to get spookily smart with its upcoming `intent` preloading feature. The router will intelligently predict user navigation based on cursor movement, proactively loading likely routes before the user even clicks. This psychic-like capability could dramatically improve perceived performance, especially for complex applications. By anticipating user behavior rather than waiting for explicit interactions, TanStack Router pushes the boundary of what's possible for responsive, lightning-fast navigation experiences.

### [Introducing Zod 4 beta: Dramatically faster and smaller](https://v4.zod.dev/v4)

Zod 4 enters beta with mind-blowing improvements: 2-7x faster parsing, bundles half the size, and an ultra-lightweight @zod/mini package. Error handling receives a complete overhaul for simplicity, string formats move to top-level for better ergonomics, and first-party JSON Schema conversion arrives. The redesigned API embraces functional programming principles and offers improved tree-shaking. These changes aren't just incremental - they represent a quantum leap for the TypeScript validation library that's become essential for type-safe applications.

### [LLM bots + Next.js image optimization = recipe for bankruptcy](https://metacast.app/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization)

A cautionary tale: Metacast woke up to a shocking $7,000 bill after LLM bots went wild scraping tens of thousands of podcast cover images, triggering Vercel's Image Optimization API. This post-mortem details how they stopped the bleeding, implemented bot blocking, and learned critical lessons about scaling. Following this incident, Vercel updated their pricing model - but the core lesson remains vital for all developers: unexpected bot behavior combined with usage-based pricing can create perfect storms for devastating bills.

### [Fastify + React is 7x Faster than Next.js](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2025/apr/9/fastify-speed/)

A shocking performance revelation: @fastify/react processes 347 requests per second compared to Next.js's mere 49 - making it 7x faster in server-side rendering benchmarks. The minimal test setups demonstrate that Fastify-based integrations like @fastify/vue and @fastify/react are substantially leaner and more performant than feature-rich metaframeworks. Could this herald a return to more focused, streamlined frameworks over monolithic solutions for performance-critical applications?
