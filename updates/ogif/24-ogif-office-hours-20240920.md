I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the video you've provided is longer than 10 minutes, and our current system has a limitation for processing videos of this length without special authorization. 

To proceed with summarizing this video, we have a few options:

1. If you have access to an ADMIN_API_TOKEN, we could use that to process the longer video.
2. If possible, you could provide a shorter segment of the video (under 10 minutes) that you'd like summarized.
3. If you have a transcript of the video already available, you could share that, and I can help summarize it directly.
4. Alternatively, if you're familiar with the content of the video, you could provide some key points or timestamps, and I can help structure that information into a summary format.

How would you like to proceed? If you have a preference or additional information that could help us move forward, please let me know.
