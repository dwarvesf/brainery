To summarize the video transcription, I'll need to use the youtube_transcription function to get the transcript. However, I'm missing one required parameter: the language. Let me ask for that information.

What language would you like the transcript in? This is typically the primary language spoken in the video. If you're unsure, we can try with "en" for English.
