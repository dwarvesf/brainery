# Weekly Changelog
## New
- Google form integration in agent dashboard via iframe, however, this has a drawback
	- The integration works but is subjected to CORS policy, and in google form there is one question type that requires google account authentication which violates the aforementioned policy.
	- As of now, there is no problem because none of the clients is using that question type yet and we'll get more time to figure out a way to do this cleanly.
- The spec for chained relays is in - access it [here](https://www.notion.so/Chained-Relays-Mini-Spec-44d2763aad654a5498832165e63a3479)

## Improvements
- Added toast to grab the user's attention.
- Add back sign-up with logic through Google first-time login.
- In dropoff email jobs, separate email preparation & email delivery so that we can retry sending those emails without spamming users.

## Planning for next week
- Tuan: design migration
- Minh: relay timezone
- Lap: update relay content and details
