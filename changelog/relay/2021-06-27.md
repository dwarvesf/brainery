# Weekly Changelog
## New
- Timezone features.
- The due date of a relay message has also been reworded to reduce the cognitive load of users e.g: you can immediately recognize "Due tomorrow at 09:15" instead of "Due 07/02/2021", the same with "Ended yesterday at 11:00"

## Improvements
- Add a readme file for Slack integration development.

## Fixes
- Fix bugs in Slack integration due to recent changes.
- Fix bugs & improve UI for Dashboard after new UI update.
- Fix bugs & improve error response logic in the BE.

## Planning for next week
- Tuan, Lap: work on the chain relay, this will be a good opportunity to use feature flagging as it will allow for easier rollout and reduce the chance of system crashing because of errors/bugs in new features.
