# Weekly Changelog
## New
- Add a feature to duplicate a relay based on the existing one.
- Add a feature to mark relay messages as complete.
- A new sidebar and an account page.

## Improvements
- Fix some UI bugs & add some minor logic improvement on Dashboard.
- The reminder feature will now also send reminder emails to users.

## Announcements
Since the project is getting bigger now, so is the amount of small improvements/bugs that come with it. To that end, the team agreed that it is a good idea to dedicate a day once every two weeks to focus on squashing bugs and hammering out those small improvements that we never got a chance to work on during the week.

## Planning for next week
- Tuan: design migration
- Lap: refactor relay creation logic
- Minh: timezone issue
