# Weekly Changelog

**It's been a long time since the last changelog and this time it is sure to bring good news - Relay finally has paying customers**

## New
- New email templates are added to the self-serve flow making it more engaging for the user when they use the extension for the first time.
- In addition to that, users will also be shown a friendly welcome screen with tips to get started.
- On the other hand, as much as we expect users to enjoy Relay, we must also prepare for when they decide to stop using it. However, we must treat every failure as an opportunity to improve, that's why we're collecting user feedback as well.
- Users now have the ability to create a relay with both content link and short text.

## Planning for next week
- One of the next major work is the chain relay concept - basically a sequence of relays that perform certain actions on certain conditions.
- Next week. Tuan and Lap will wrap up their work and work on the above mentioned feature.
