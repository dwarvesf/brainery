# Weekly Changelog
## New
- Users can now create relays via the Relay bot's shortcut.
- A minor change to the meaning of the badge number, previously it was used to show the number of **unseen** relay messages, this approach had worked well until Slack integration was introduced and because relay messages created via Slack cannot have **seen** event action so it automatically has the **seen** status upon created which causes the badge to show a number 1 and then disappear, sort of like a flicker effect. This results in bad UX so the team decided to change the number to indicate the number of **incomplete** relay messages. (that is, the sum of all **unseen, seen, in\_progress** relay messages)
- This week we also discussed the migration from the current notification mechanism to a new one for better UX. We've got feedback that the notifications don't seem to be showing up consistently across devices and this has somewhat to do with system-level settings which are impossible for an extension to intercept. Instead, we planned to move to a more sophisticated UI. (check below for Grammarly references)


## Planning for next week
- Since the new notification requires extension knowledge, Tuan will work on that.
- Lap will in turn handle the self-serve flow
