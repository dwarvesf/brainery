# Weekly Changelog
## New
- Make the Google button more prominent.
- Add password complexity validation.
- Lead can now invite users.
- Some bug fixes and UI update for Slack app to match with Web & Extension
- Google Form integration - a feature that will automatically complete the relay upon form submission <- We've been reported that users often forget to mark the relay as completed after they've taken the quiz. This is how we think it might prove useful for users.
## Planning for next week
- Lap will wrap up life cycle emails and some backend migration work.
- Tuan will continue with Agent Dashboard.
