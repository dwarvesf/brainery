# Weekly Changelog
## Improvements
- Improve logic for invitation flow. Users can now resend the invitation email & update invited users' email.
- Improve logic for marking relay messages as complete. Now it will update both Open Rate & Complete Rate.
- UI update & logic improvement to improve app's security based on pentest:
    - More generic error messages to prevent user email enumeration.
    - Prevent brute-force attempts for some scenarios: login, email confirmation, requesting reset password email.
- Also limiting the number of emails that can be requested per N seconds to reduce server load & prevent DDOS.
- There is also a pending pull request for the timezone-related feature but it was interrupted by the penetration report mentioned above which seemed far more crucial so we had to postpone the task (shout out to Minh and Lap for being responsive and jumped right to the pentest task as soon as it appeared). The timezone feature will ideally be merged next week.
- Most of the small improvements/bugs have been addressed on Friday. (our first BugBash session)

## Planning for next week
- Minh: finalize the timezone feature.
- Tuan: continue to hammer out remaining improvement tasks.
- Lap: start working on the chained relay.
