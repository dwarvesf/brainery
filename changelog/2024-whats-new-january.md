In this first month of 2024, we kept tap of what's brewing in the tech market, while reviewing what we went through in 2023.

- **[[#Reporting tech signals]]** - Updates on the stage of React, Rust, AI, Cybersecurity, Rust.
- **[[#Dwarves' YEP 2023]]** - One of the rare event where Dwarves and community members gather.
- **[[#Dwarves' 2023 in review]]** - A recap of Dwarves in 2023

## Reporting tech signals
Every month we watch tech trends closely to depict which ones have high potential, and can be part of our growing tech stack.

This month highlights:

- Not-so-great news for React from the lack of updates and core members leaving
- The rapidly growing interest HTMX
- The idea of “Rewrite It In Rust” (RIIR) coming to life as more and more projects move to Rust
- In-house AI-assisted productivity tools on the rise
- LLMs stepping away from OpenAI
- Trading bots
- Cybersecurity taking the center stage

## Monthly top performers
Each month we track how productive and valuable each of our team members by using delivery points. The top 5 high-performing members get rewards with $ICY. 

In January, kudos to those peeps who outperformed the rest: Ngoc Thanh, Chinh Le, Cuong Mai, Tai Pham, Phat Nguyen

## Dwarves' 2023 in review
2023 consisted of shifts and changes almost every step of the way. We managed to pull through, and it's all because of the hard work of our members, along with the trust from our clients & partners.

Our top ten achievements through 2023 are chosen by voting from everyone. With half of them are team-related, while the other half are community-related, it shows we are still on the right path to "50% company, 50% community".

- Biggest contract renewal from clients of all time
- Bounty program for community grant reached $30k
- Monthly product demos and showcases
- System for rewarding monthly top performers and contributors
- Dwarves & Techie communities reach 40k members in total
- Frontend training course with 180 community members participated
- Golang training course with 82 community members participated
- 102 published stories about human in tech, 77 tech events and radio talks

## Dwarves' YEP 2023
We chose to host our YEP 2023 earlier than most companies, so that our team members can go home a bit earlier, spending a bit more time with their loved ones. 

Our YEP is also a bit different. It's a full one-day event filled with multiple activities, as we aim for teamwork, team bonding and also, tremendous fun.

- 400 mil VND was spent as awards and gifts for everyone
- 105 mil VND was spent donating to tree planting across Vietnam

Thank you to all the team members, partners, alumni and community members who joined in with us. We hope to have more fun things for everyone to take part in next year.
