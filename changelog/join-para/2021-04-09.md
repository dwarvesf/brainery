# Apr 9th, 2021 - Weekly Changelog
## Improvements
This week, our works mainly on the BE side included continuing to refactor coding convention and implementing new features. FE still **blocked** by some issues related to **BE** side.
- **Ohlas** is upgraded to using the new **filestore** package and move client logic back from **praca**
- **PARAMVP-131** is on **WIP**. We have to extend the **supply profile** model to store the reviewed status

## Updates
As we mentioned above, the root cause of blocker is including:
-   **Praca** wasn't deployed to the latest version.
-   The backend server is not stable.
-   **PARAMVP-286** still is on WIP

Kareem intended to be completed PARAMVP-286 this weekend. So Nam can continue his work to finish the rest thing of PARAMVP-40 **(vaccination and medical screening).** Before he can completely finish this ticket, Nam will continue to do PARAMVP-131.
