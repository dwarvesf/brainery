Successfully went through 2022, a year that we might say -  a new record: team reached highest growth record, kickstarted community engagement, home, compliance training & individual development are speeding up, and a whole new place to call Dwarves.

We’ve achieved to this year’s resolution: A team that cares about how to build software right and can teach others on that. 

# **TEAM GROWTH**

### 30 New Team Members
---

<span style='color:red'>**[2022 matched us with the 80th Dwarves](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook)**</span>. A notable highlight, and we're ready to have more. It's not easy finding like-minded people. It takes true & solid seeks. Even though people come and go, the spirits stay.

Expanding the team doesn’t mean we have to disregard our culture. We have launched <span style='color:red'>[a mechanism](/1f6986deb0db47769ddd7e9012699740?v=bb092c96e7fa49e6b649b0c97f94b552&p=54bb5134519d421da539fcd6396faf20&pm=s)</span><span style='color:red'> </span>to help us protect our culture and co-create our future using tech. For us, approval happens when someone is accepted by the team, not by management.

### The Next Leading Chairs
---

Launching 3 offices across the country - Saigon, Danang, and Dalat, more initiatives to distribute our software know-how, and a <span style='color:red'>**46% growth**</span> in team scale calls for a different way to run the business. Shifting from a remote working model to a hybrid working model is a must, but it wasn’t easy. 

The bigger team and the new model require more hands on deck. Instead of the old-school Board of Directors, we divide our leadership team based on what each member delivers.

### R&D Team
---

Research and Development (R&D) came about as a collective department for solving common problems we encounter across all of our projects. As an innovative software firm, we found that the foundations for creating software are vital to making them successful.

After its launch, the R&B has completed the first challenge: **Feature Flags**<span style='color:red'>. </span>

Feature Flags tackled a concern spanning across our DevOps, Management, and Engineering domains.

* **Feature flags**: Options to enable/disable a feature in the application to help developers have a good experience and improve performance in the development process. We have discovered 3 solutions to resolve this challenge. With a wide range of solutions, we have the ability to serve any type of usage and project in development life.
* **The detailed solutions:**

*A 2022 look back on our Brainery timeline, with a total of 128 notes contributed.*
The concept of <span style='color:red'>**“The Fastest Learners Win”**</span> has always been big between the Dwarves. 2022 though, we opened our learning initiatives to the tech community. Everyone can join in to learn with us, sharing their experience with us, then get rewarded in return for their contribution.

The response so far has been amazing. We got words saying peeps get to upgrade their skills and work smoother in their projects.

Just a bit of research on new tech could mean a job opportunity, or perhaps a turning point in their life that make them leaders in a new segment of an industry.

Came after [Summit 2022](/a97f5ddc0611460abc0212b4ba5d10d4), we’ve piloted a few games such as [Hunger Game](https://df-hunger-game.netlify.app/) and [Treasure Hunt ](https://hunt.d.foundation/)apps. Heading toward the engineering-driven vision, we founded a game department to create more engaging activities that offer our engineers and community a thrilling and adventurous gaming experience.

# Workplace growth 

### L**aunching Home-like Dwarves Hubs in Danang and Dalat**
---

Since June 2020, we've been planning on a new office, a cozy studio in Da Lat and a summer house in Danang. It’s our **second initiative**: Dwarves Hubs should be placed across the country to offer our team a comfy remote experience when they need it. After the pandemic, as a new chapter, we’re proud of how it turned out, our first time went from sketches to reality - Danang and Dalat Hub.
