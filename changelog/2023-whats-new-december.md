## Reporting tech signals

Technologies move fast. We're not ones to get left behind. Every month we watch tech trends closely to depict which ones have high potential, and can be part of our growing tech stack.

This month highlights strong signals on AI gaining mainstream traction, the comeback of WebGPU, Actor Model in computing, Security and ComplianceAsCode, nNFT standards for asset provenance. And programming-language-wise: Rust, Lua Dart.

## Monthly top performers
Each month we track how productive and valuable each of our team members by using delivery points. For now, the top 5 high-performing members get rewards with $ICY. In Dec, kudos to those peeps who outperformed the rest: Nam Nguyen, Lap Nguyen, Ngoc Thanh, Jim and Hung Vong.

Last month we also shipped quite a number of features, highlighting:

- [Mochi UI](https://mochiui.com/) - an open source IU library for every software project
- Rust game - an inhouse game we're developing for our upcoming summit

## Dwarves of the Year 2023

## Performance Review
The Dwarves way. We don't just base on our review by performance, but also on everyone's effort to grow in their career. As our theme for the year is MMA (Mastery, Meaning, Autonomy), we develop a system of metrics to make sure our engineers are not only skilled, but also head toward higher purpose.
