> Testing the water validates our consulting service for new tech by finding 5-10 early clients fast. We distribute through communities, partners, and campaigns, learning quickly to stay ahead in a shifting market.

### Why we test the water

Testing the water is how we roll out our new consulting service for emerging technology, like AI or blockchain, and see if it resonates with clients. Think of it as dipping your toes in to gauge interest before diving in fully. We package our expertise, find early clients, craft business cases, and push the service out to validate its fit. This is our lean startup moment, keeping feedback loops short so we can adapt quickly.

Our goal? Land the first 10 clients who are ready to engage, the ones we call front-beach clients. For a small to medium team, this can take 1 to 3 months. I’ve seen it happen in just a week with a few targeted pings or social posts.

### What holds us back

Let’s be honest, procrastination can stall us. Even we sometimes delay launching a new service. Here’s why that happens, and how we can push through:

- Fear of failure. If the service doesn’t land well, it can hit our confidence hard.
- Doubt in the market thesis. If the team isn’t sold on the tech’s potential, they won’t push it.
- Lack of leadership drive. If the project lead isn’t fully committed, momentum fades.

What’s the fix? Move fast to minimize the struggle. Make the market thesis your belief, something you’re excited to pitch. When you’re all in, it’s easier to get others on board.

### Know your audience

Figure out who needs this consulting service, who’s eager to leverage new tech to solve their problems. Set a clear, manageable target, like aiming for 5 or 10 clients. Trends in tech don’t last forever. With the internet, AI, and the singularity getting closer, tech cycles are shrinking. Adoption happens fast, but so does the drop-off. Don’t expect the market to wait.

Online, solutions spread quickly. Distributors push tech services through ads, platforms, news, and more. Before the internet, things took time. Now, speed is everything.

### How to distribute

Distribution is about finding channels that work for our consulting service. Look for two things: traffic, and a low cost-to-traffic rate. You can tap into these channels by building trust, paying for access, or both. Here’s how we do it.

#### Join the community

Get active in communities focused on the tech we’re consulting on. Keep it real, don’t fake it. Follow your thesis, stay open-minded, and act like a learner. Share insights, and learn from others. Growing with the community is my go-to way to show we’re experts in the space.

#### Work with sales partners

Connect with technologists who are passionate about new tech. They might not be salespeople, they could be a PM, tech manager, CTO, or CEO. We’re all human first, and we all want to push tech forward. Be a leader who builds ties with other leaders, and opportunities will come.

#### Tap into VCs

VCs and investors have connections. They love adding value to their portfolio companies, especially with consulting services for new tech. A quick intro from them can open doors. Build trust, and they’ll help spread the word.

#### Find super connectors

Every market has people who know everyone, or who everyone knows. These super connectors are key. Gain their trust, or become their go-to consultant. They can get your service in front of the right people fast.

#### Run your own campaign

Campaigns aren’t my first choice for consulting, but they can help. Think of them as an info campaign, a way for your network or potential clients to learn about your service. Don’t expect a flood of leads, but you might get a few. Focus on the cost to acquire each lead. A good campaign includes:

- The consulting service and expertise you offer.
- The cost to deliver it.
- What clients get in return.

Tweak these settings to hit your goal. Keep it simple, and don’t overthink it.

### Set up a benefit package

When we bring others into the process, we share the wins. That’s good business. Draft a quick one-page cheatsheet for everyone involved, like partners or early clients. Numbers can shift as you go, so don’t stress over perfection. In a new tech market, everyone’s open to exploring. Just have a benefit package ready to show you’re serious.

### Why this matters

Testing the water isn’t just about validation, it’s about learning fast. We take small bets with our consulting service, see what clicks with clients, and double down on what works. This keeps us sharp and ready for whatever the market throws at us. It’s how we stay ahead in a tech world that never slows down.
