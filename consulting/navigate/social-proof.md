## The catch-22

Clients only buy from people who have already done the thing. If you haven’t done the thing, you don’t get clients. If you don’t get clients, you never do the thing. The loop is brutal and most people spend years trying to break it the "fair" way—sending cold pitches with zero credibility and wondering why no one replies.

The economy does not reward playing fair; it rewards playing well. Below are three ways to play well.

## 1. Monetary association claim

**Rule:** never lead with the artifact you built; lead with the money it moved.

| Weak claim                              | Strong claim                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built a marketing system for XYZ agency | Generated $15k in two weeks through a marketing system      |
| Wrote a React component library         | Reduced page-load cost by $8k/mo with a component library |
| Did a summer internship at a fintech    | Saved a fintech $120k annually by pruning dead features     |

If you don’t have direct revenue numbers, borrow them:

- "Built the same checkout flow that powers $50M of Shopify GMV."
- "Deployed the same fraud model that caught $3M in attempts at Stripe."

The dollar sign is the universal language; everything else is dialect.

## 2. Team association principle

You do not need to have worked _for_ Google; you only need to have worked _with_ someone who works at Google.

1. Pick a big-name company in your niche.
2. On LinkedIn, filter for non-executive employees (they say yes more often).
3. Offer a micro-deliverable worth ≥ $500: scrape their last ten posts and write ten more in their tone, build a Notion dashboard, audit their landing page Core Web Vitals—anything that takes you < 1 day but saves them > 1 hour.
4. Deliver, then add one line to your bio: "Have delivered value for people on the Google Ads team."

Use the qualifier "members of" or "people at" so the claim stays truthful. The brand rubs off; the objection "Has this person done the thing?" disappears.

## 3. Overflow contractor method

When you have neither money nor logos, trade _leads_ for _logos_.

1. Buy or scrape 50 qualified leads you cannot yet service.
2. Cold-call niche agencies: "I have leads I can’t fulfill—want them for 15 % referral?"
3. Sign a one-page referral agreement that lets you list them as "team members."
4. Now your site can truthfully say: "Our videographers have shot for Gillette, Pfizer, and three Fortune 500s."

You are not claiming you shot the spots—only that _members of your extended team_ did. The prospect’s brain hears the brands and stops asking questions.

## Compound interest

Each tactic above is interest-bearing. Stack them:

- Week 1: land two monetary claims worth $40 k combined.
- Week 3: add a Microsoft association.
- Week 6: overflow five agencies and inherit their client list.

After 60 days you can write: "I’ve helped teams that have generated over $1 M in new revenue and worked with people at Microsoft, Shopify, and Stripe." All technically true, all acquired with time instead of track record.

## Ethics guardrails

- Never claim you _worked for_ a company when you only worked _with_ an employee.
- Never invent dollar figures; associate with existing ones.
- Always deliver the free value you promised; reputation compounds faster than any hack.

Social proof is not a static asset—it is a resource you manufacture by strategically trading time, value, and language. Start today and you can buy yourself a million dollars of credibility before the quarter ends.
