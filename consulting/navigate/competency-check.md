> Ensure team competency: assess collective know-how, ask forward-looking questions, stay **relevant** in tech cycles, and onboard passionate learners.

In tech consulting, our team’s competency is what keeps us in the game, and it’s all about our **collective tech know-how**. We’re not talking about individual performance reviews here, this is about how we, as a whole, stay on top of the tech world’s constant shifts. By asking the right questions and building a team of passionate learners, we ensure we’re always ready for the next big thing. Here’s how we can assess and improve our team’s competency to avoid falling behind.

## Assess with simple leading questions

Our **competency check is about staying relevant**, and it starts with asking simple, forward-looking questions.

- Is there a new paradigm we need to understand?
- Where’s the tech scene moving?
- Can we build the latest software with confidence?
- What percentage of our team can understand and jump on the next tech wave?

These questions help us see if we’re keeping up with the industry’s direction. For example, if AI-driven automation is the new trend, we need to know how many of us can tackle it. This quick check gives us a clear picture of our team’s strengths and gaps, so we can act before we’re left behind.

## Stay relevant in tech cycles

Tech moves in cycles, and we’re only as good as our last delivery. If the next cycle hits and we’re not ready, we risk **becoming irrelevant**, which is the same as being incompetent in this fast-paced world. Let’s say we’re great at building traditional web apps, but the industry shifts to serverless architecture, if we’re not prepared, we’ll struggle to win deals. Our competency check helps us avoid this by spotting where we need to grow, whether it’s learning a new framework or understanding emerging paradigms, so we can stay competitive and keep delivering value.

## Build a team of passionate learners

One of the best ways to stay ahead is to build a team of people who are **passionate about tech**, not just learning because they have to, but because they want to. We continuously look for these self-motivated learners who naturally stay on top of trends. They’re the ones who’ll dive into the latest tech wave on their own, keeping our team sharp without constant pushing. For instance, a developer who’s excited about AI will already be exploring it, bringing that knowledge to the table. This passion-driven approach ensures our collective know-how grows organically, keeping us ready for whatever comes next.

## Squad up and stay sharp

We’ve got a simple plan to keep our team’s competency on point! By asking **forward-looking questions**, staying ahead of **tech cycles**, and building a team of **passionate learners**, we ensure our **squad stays relevant**. Let’s keep checking and growing so we never fall behind.
