* CJC Ptd is a 20-year expert in providing market data consultancy & professional services for global financial sector.
* They want to make a new data ecosystem: Public and private cloud, containerization, software orchestration, AI to support the growth of DevOps
* We team up with them to develop <span style='color:blue'>**Voconic**</span> - a cloud PaaS for CJC’s clients, aiming to make cloud deployment seamless across cloud providers and environment.

### <span style='color:blue'>Technical Highlight</span>

---

* Backend, Frontend and CLI tools are built from scratch by engineers specialized in Cloud development
* Golang heavy backend integrated with Google Cloud Platform for <span style='color:blue'>1-click deployment </span>experience
* Deep integration with multiple cloud providers (Google & AWS)
* Complex system auto-deployment and configuration function
* CLI support for repetitive tasks and complex operation
* Separated services for file upload. This divides chunk files into smaller packs with cache data, which optimizes large files uploading process (reduce CPU & RAM)
* Automation test for product deployment on GCP (automated deploy and delete product on GCP)
