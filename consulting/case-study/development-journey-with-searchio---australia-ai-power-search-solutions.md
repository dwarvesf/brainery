### In brief
* Founded in 2017 and reached a total seed funding of $4M by 2020, Search.io, formerly Sajari, is an AI-powered search and product discovery platform that helps eCommerce brands and retailers maximize their revenue and conversion rates through outcome-focused, real-time search result optimization.
* The Dwarves partnered with Search.io to help with their Console dashboard app, improve open-source packages quality and tailor the brand UI for plugin consumers.
* Search.io is one of those matured projects that requires stability over speed. Everything we do, we do with plans and foreseeable vision.

### Technical Highlight
* Self-built design system component package to successfully migrate the old console UI to the new one.
* React SDK: The open-source library we develop that has been started as another branch for Shopify integration

### The Context
[Search.io](http://search.io/) drives business performance through bespoke online discovery service. Accessible via crawler or API, it provides human-like understanding at machine speed.
That comes with a full package of platform integration, search through images, A/B testing via crawler and API listing support.
ðŸ”¸ Search.io must ensures an optimal user experience. It aims to make the services more accessible. 

That explains the work on open-source and search-widget support.

### Engagement Model
The work focuses on refactoring the Console dashboard app, improving the open-source package's quality, and tailoring brand UI for plugin consumers.
* Console dashboard app: A platform that collects all data provided by user/ consumers to index and make their websites searchable. 
* Open-source package: Search.io is now growing. They decided to start a series of open source libraries to make it developer-friendly. 

This makes Search.io more accessible to a broader audience and creates a frictionless searching setup.

* React SDK: One of the libraries we develop and open source for public use, it is currently the main and most well-developed in the open-source series

Working with a growing team like Search.io, we ensure the stability to map with their current process. Plans and discussions are a must before every feature. Showcase demo happens on Friday to sync up the work and provide team feedback.
