## What we did with KAFI

KAFI Securities approached us with a critical challenge: their trading platform had evolved into a highly complex system that was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and extend. As a technology-driven financial services firm, KAFI recognized that their competitive advantage depended on their ability to rapidly adapt their platform to market needs and regulatory requirements.

The platform's complexity stemmed from years of organic growth, integrating various trading systems, risk management tools, and third-party services. While this approach had served them well, it created significant technical debt and made it challenging to onboard new development teams or implement new features quickly.

> **Core Challenge**: KAFI needed a partner who could not only understand their complex legacy system but also modernize it without disrupting the critical daily operations that thousands of traders depended on.

We worked directly with KAFI's leadership, product, and operations teams to develop a systematic approach to taking over development responsibilities. Our goal was to establish ourselves as an extension of their team while bringing modern development practices and architectural improvements to their platform.

## The challenges KAFI faced

KAFI's trading platform presented several interconnected challenges that required careful navigation:

### Technical complexity without documentation

- **Undocumented architecture**: Years of development had created a system where knowledge existed primarily in the minds of long-term developers
- **Hidden dependencies**: Critical system interactions weren't mapped, making changes risky
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Quick fixes and workarounds had compounded over time
- **Knowledge silos**: Different teams held pieces of the system understanding with no unified view

### Operational criticality

- **Zero tolerance for downtime**: The platform processed millions in daily transactions
- **Real-time requirements**: Trading systems demand microsecond-level performance
- **Regulatory compliance**: Financial regulations required careful handling of any system changes
- **24/7 operations**: Market hours and global trading meant limited maintenance windows

### Growth constraints

- **Scaling difficulties**: Adding new features or integrations took increasingly longer
- **Resource limitations**: Difficulty onboarding new developers due to system complexity
- **Business agility**: Rapid market changes required faster platform evolution
- **Future-proofing needs**: Plans for expansion required a more flexible architecture

These challenges created a situation where KAFI's technical capabilities were becoming a bottleneck to their business growth, despite their strong market position and tech-driven approach.

## How we built it

Our approach to modernizing KAFI's platform centered on **systematic transition and knowledge transfer** while maintaining operational stability. We developed a three-phase strategy that allowed us to gradually assume development responsibilities without disrupting critical trading operations.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive system audit

We began with an intensive audit to understand the full scope of KAFI's technology landscape:

- **Architecture mapping**: Created detailed diagrams of system components and their interactions
- **Code analysis**: Reviewed millions of lines of code to identify patterns, dependencies, and risk areas
- **Infrastructure assessment**: Documented deployment processes, server configurations, and scaling mechanisms
- **Workflow documentation**: Mapped existing development and operational procedures

This audit phase was crucial for understanding not just what the system did, but why it was built that way. We discovered numerous undocumented business rules embedded in code and critical integrations that weren't immediately apparent.

### Phase 2: Gradual transition and knowledge transfer

With a clear understanding of the system, we implemented a carefully orchestrated transition:

- **Parallel operations**: Our team worked alongside KAFI's developers for seamless knowledge transfer
- **Incremental responsibility**: Started with non-critical components before moving to core systems
- **Documentation creation**: Built comprehensive technical documentation as we learned each subsystem
- **Process establishment**: Introduced structured development workflows without disrupting existing operations

> **Key Innovation**: We developed a **"shadow development" approach** where our team would first observe, then assist, and finally lead development efforts for each system component. This ensured zero disruption while building confidence on both sides.

### Phase 3: Modernization and extension

Once established as the primary development team, we began systematic improvements:

- **Technical debt reduction**: Refactored critical components while maintaining functionality
- **Integration acceleration**: Built frameworks for rapid integration with new platforms
- **Performance optimization**: Improved system response times for critical trading operations
- **Monitoring enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive observability for proactive issue detection

### Technical approach

Our modernization strategy balanced stability with innovation:

- **Reverse engineering methodology**: Systematic documentation of undocumented systems and business logic
- **Risk-based prioritization**: Focused on high-impact, low-risk improvements first
- **Modular refactoring**: Isolated system components to enable independent updates
- **Continuous integration**: Established automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Knowledge management**: Created living documentation that evolved with the system

### How we collaborated

Success required deep integration with KAFI's teams:

- **Daily standups** with product and operations teams to align priorities
- **Joint troubleshooting** sessions for critical issues, building trust through shared problem-solving
- **Knowledge sharing workshops** where our team presented findings and recommendations
- **Technical advisory role** in strategic decisions about platform evolution
- **24/7 support rotation** ensuring coverage for critical trading hours

This collaborative approach transformed us from an external vendor into a trusted technical partner, deeply invested in KAFI's success.

## What we achieved

Our partnership with KAFI Securities delivered transformative results across technical, operational, and strategic dimensions:

### Technical transformation

- **Comprehensive system documentation**: Created detailed technical documentation covering architecture, workflows, and business logic that previously existed only as tribal knowledge
- **Reduced onboarding time**: New developers can now become productive in weeks rather than months
- **Improved system stability**: Proactive monitoring and structured processes reduced critical incidents by identifying issues before they impacted trading
- **Accelerated delivery**: Integration with new platforms now measured in days rather than weeks

### Operational excellence

- **70–80% development ownership**: Dwarves Foundation successfully assumed majority responsibility for platform development
- **Zero-downtime transition**: Completed the entire transition without a single trading disruption
- **Structured workflows**: Introduced development practices that improved team efficiency and code quality
- **Knowledge continuity**: Eliminated single points of failure through comprehensive documentation

### Strategic partnership

- **Technical decision-making**: Became actively involved in architectural and technology strategy decisions
- **Future-ready platform**: Positioned KAFI's system for planned expansions and new business initiatives
- **Risk mitigation**: Detailed system health reports identified and addressed potential issues proactively
- **Capability transfer**: KAFI's internal teams adopted our development workflows and best practices

> **Client Impact**: "The Dwarves Foundation team didn't just take over our development – they transformed how we think about and manage our technology platform. They've become an integral part of our technical strategy." – KAFI Leadership

Our work with KAFI demonstrates how systematic approaches to legacy system modernization can unlock business potential while maintaining operational stability. By combining deep technical expertise with careful transition planning, we helped KAFI transform their complex platform from a constraint into a competitive advantage.

The partnership continues to evolve, with our team now deeply embedded in KAFI's technology operations and actively shaping their platform's future. This case study exemplifies how thoughtful technical partnerships can enable financial services firms to maintain their edge in rapidly evolving markets.
