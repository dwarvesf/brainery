What started out as a weekend passion project quickly progressed into a strong, proud, aspiring community. 10 years in, <span style='color:red'>[startup.vn](http://startup.vn/)</span> is now one of the fast-growing entrepreneurial ecosystems in Vietnam, representing Vietnam at Startups Nation ([Global Entrepreneurship Network](https://www.genglobal.org/)).
