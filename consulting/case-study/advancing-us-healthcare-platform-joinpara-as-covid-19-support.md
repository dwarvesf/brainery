## Engagement Model
### Team size
The Dwarves initially joined in with 1 Backend Engineer. Working together with Para team, we helped build a sturdy backend system to sort out different logics. 

Para's app serves multiple purposes and deals with a loaded volume of data. We went for a microservice architecture built from Go.

When the system has been set up, our Designer and her director stepped in. Using Figma & Sketch, we delivered a stunning brush-up for Para's mobile app's interface. The app covered both Android & iOS versions for a wider user segment. Then our Frontend Engineer continued turning those canvas into a digital display. 

Throughout the process, we keep 1 PM in the team to oversee and provide on-time consultancy. With a team of 5, we stayed aligned and respected Para's business goal to maintain flexibility during the development stage.

### Tech stacks
- Backend: Microservices, Go
- Frontend: React, Redux, Material UI
- Database: MySQL
- Infra: GKE, Google Cloud

### Communication
- Slack & Google Meets: Team discussion

## Outcome
Through more than 6 months of working on the remaining features, we got to launch a shape MVP release on time - a fully functioning app for nurse shifting schedules. 

JoinPara app is a finetune product ready to demo for various clients, empowering Para to reach more funding opportunities and expand the market.
