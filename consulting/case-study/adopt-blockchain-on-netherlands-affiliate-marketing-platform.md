* Our team of 3 join them to contribute to Attrace's core function with custom-made blockchain technology

## Highlight
* Blockchain solutions for multiples use-cases
* Golang for Backend system: Solidity and index blockchain data

## The Context
Attrace's concept is a marketing platform that helps merchants feature and advertise their products.

Hazy cashflow may create loopholes for security fraud. Attrace moves the network activity to blockchain-based for cost-reduction and data privacy management. 

Attrace's blockchain network logs agreements between parties through a smart contract & linked to individual clicks.

ðŸŒ€ We build Attrace with **blockchain-nodes**. It provides transparent transactions, creates secure networks and real-time communications between parties.

**Rely heavily on ETH**
ETH based network is primely used to create decentralized which are not in existence prior. It decreases the chance of fraud, built and run on smart contracts. Exists as a middle man to eliminate third-party users from leveraging the network loophole. 

ETH isn't the only chain we keep in mind. Attrace team is working on more chain integration for a widen user segment. 

## Engagement Model
Attrace provides solutions to apply referral into blockchain products (IDO, Liquidity Pool, or NFT). With every case comes a smart contract to define the related metrics. A verifier network will then tracks those metrics, and payout for the relevant stakeholders.

**Tech stacks**
* Backend: Solidity & Index in Golang
* Frontend: React
* Files sharing system: IPFS
* Infras: k8s, AWS
* Monitoring: Prometheus
* Verifier network: Golang
Data must be propagated in blockchain. Leverage IPFS keeps data persistently available with access control. Meanwhile, it prevents data from being bloated by relying on cryptographic hashes. 

**Communication**
Slack chat & Trello task management.

## Outcome
We rolled out the MVP version after 9 months. Followed by The Outlet Launch (NFT Cashback) and deep integration in multiples wallets.

Notably such as achieving pBFT for the consensus protocol, building a network connector (for consumers to interact with Attraceâ€™s blockchain network) and a dashboard for campaigns management.

Attrace marked up their next highlights with an achievement streak
