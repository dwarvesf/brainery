## <span style='color:blue'>The Context</span>

Attrace's concept is a marketing platform that helps merchants feature and advertise their products.

Hazy cashflow may create loopholes for security fraud. Attrace moves the network activity to blockchain-based for cost-reduction and data privacy management. 

Attrace's blockchain network logs agreements between parties through a smart contract & linked to individual clicks.

ðŸŒ€ We build Attrace with <span style='color:blue'>**blockchain-nodes**</span>. It provides transparent transactions, creates secure networks and real-time communications between parties.


<span style='color:blue'>**Rely heavily on ETH**</span>

---

ETH based network is primely used to create decentralized which are not in existence prior. It decreases the chance of fraud, built and run on smart contracts. Exists as a middle man to eliminate third-party users from leveraging the network loophole. 

ETH isn't the only chain we keep in mind. Attrace team is working on more chain integration for a widen user segment. 


## <span style='color:blue'>Engagement Model</span>

---

Attrace provides solutions to apply referral into blockchain products (IDO, Liquidity Pool, or NFT). With every case comes a smart contract to define the related metrics. A verifier network will then tracks those metrics, and payout for the relevant stakeholders.

<!-- column 51527a49-be38-4e75-998e-6f9e3945d542 -->

<span style='color:blue'>**Tech stacks**</span>

* Backend: Solidity & Index in Golang
* Frontend: React
* Files sharing system: IPFS
* Infras: k8s, AWS
* Monitoring: Prometheus
* Verifier network: Golang

<!-- column 32537c12-651d-4715-9637-8a5fb3cb5bdf -->

Data must be propagated in blockchain. Leverage IPFS keeps data persistently available with access control. Meanwhile, it prevents data from being bloated by relying on cryptographic hashes. 


<span style='color:blue'>**Communication**</span>

Slack chat & Trello task management.

<!-- column 1e9102c8-0759-418e-b9d0-8ab8b5695714 -->

We rolled out the MVP version after 9 months. Followed by The Outlet Launch (NFT Cashback) and deep integration in multiples wallets.

Notably such as <span style='color:blue'>achieving pBFT</span> for the consensus protocol, building a <span style='color:blue'>network connector</span> (for consumers to interact with Attraceâ€™s blockchain network) and <span style='color:blue'>a dashboard for campaigns management</span>.
