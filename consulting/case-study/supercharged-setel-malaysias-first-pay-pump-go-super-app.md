### In brief
* First introduced by PETRONAS in 2018, Setel is the first e-payment solution for fuel purchases directly from mobile devices.
* They head to unlock a bigger market by providing **a super-app** with on-the-go function and platform integration.
* Our team of 7 partners to involve in their engineering team in Unified Loyalty Platform, specialized in “Conversion” of new potential users. We focus on deals, vouchers, the [front-landing page](https://www.setel.com/) as well as Marketing tracking & integration.

### Highlights
* Microservice architecture
* [SWARM process](https://open.nytimes.com/scrum-swarm-sprint-how-to-take-the-agile-process-and-make-it-your-own-b6416793ff7e): Working together on a small number of stories at a time. It help spread tacit knowledge, resolve issues and avoid the random distraction.
* Testing: Manual ad-hoc test, then regression test and automation. All managed in Zephyr and Allure report.

### The Context
Setel moves toward one goal: **Making refuel experience frictionless**, which deep dive in 3 main target customers:

* **Motorists**: Setel supports a refueling process on their daily experience. 
* **Business**: Setel provides them approaches to engage with customers while automating the cash flow.
* **Developers**: With Setel, developers can work with different things, from API integration to mini app deployment.

We help build up a place where users can interact and personalize their experience with **Setel Website** and **Gifts Campaign**.

### **Engagement Model**
We work as Conversion team - fully focused on **supporting the funnel to activate client**.

Established businesses as Setel have a fixed protocol to work and operate. We need to form a team that can manage themselves independently and adopt modern business practices.

**Tech Stacks**
* Backend: TypeScript (Nest.js framework)
* Frontend: React
* Infra: AWS, Microservices
* Testing: Zephyr and Allure report
* Tooling: JIRA

**Communication**
The collaboration happens remotely (*obvs*). Tools are our best friends.

Daily communication happens in Slack, while we pick Jira for sprint tracking and Confluence for technical analysis and written-form materials.

### **Outcome**
Through months of partnership, we're glad to ship out **The Food Bank Programme**: A community-support initiative by Petronas Station Business Partners and the communities to provide essential items at selected Petronas stations nationwide.
