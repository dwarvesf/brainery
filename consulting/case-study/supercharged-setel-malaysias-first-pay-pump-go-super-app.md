### <span style='color:blue'>**Engagement Model**</span>
---

We work as Conversion team - fully focused on <span style='color:blue'>**supporting the funnel to activate client**</span>.

Established businesses as Setel have a fixed protocol to work and operate. We need to form a team that can manage themselves independently and adopt modern business practices. 
<span style='color:blue'>**Tech Stacks**</span>

* Backend: TypeScript (Nest.js framework)
* Frontend: React
* Infra: AWS, Microservices
* Testing: Zephyr and Allure report
* Tooling: JIRA
<span style='color:blue'>**Communication**</span>

The collaboration happens remotely (*obvs*). Tools are our best friends. 

Daily communication happens in Slack, while we pick Jira for sprint tracking and Confluence for technical analysis and written-form materials.

### <span style='color:blue'>**Outcome**</span>
---

Through months of partnership, we're glad to ship out <span style='color:blue'>**The Food Bank Programme**</span>: A community-support initiative by Petronas Station Business Partners and the communities to provide essential items at selected Petronas stations nationwide.
