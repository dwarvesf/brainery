Singapore dentistry market is USD $24M/ year generating by at least 688 clinics. These clinics are spending USD$2,064,000 a month on dental supplies. The growth is robust. But the operation is outdated. Disrupt the long-term habits and optimize them is challenging.

Dental Marketplace must be built to simplify the dentistry operation process.

We started everything from a fresh idea. The process started out as market research, to define business problem and structure core features.

* Microservices extendable system
* Support multiple platforms

📍 With Agile practices and Scrum framework to iterate the product release and adapt to changes, we came across as exactly what Desmond is seeking for.
