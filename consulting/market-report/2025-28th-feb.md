## Blockchain

****Bybit Hack News****

So, Bybit, this crypto exchange, had a rough day when they got hacked and lost $1.5 billion. Their CEO came out and said they’ve got enough cash to cover it though, so users don’t need to panic. Still, it’s a heads-up that even the big players can get hit by online trouble now and then.

****SEC Drops Uniswap Case****

The SEC, those U.S. rule-makers, decided to drop their case against Uniswap, a well-known crypto platform. This could shake up how crypto rules work, maybe giving blockchain projects a bit more room to breathe. People on X are calling it a solid win for the industry, and it’s easy to see why.

**Moca Network and SK Planet**

Moca Network joined forces with SK Planet to roll out something called Oki Club. It’s a pretty big deal for getting Web3, that blockchain tech, into regular businesses. The idea is to make it simpler for everyday people to dip their toes into crypto without feeling lost.

**Binance Announcement**

It’s called "Super Earn," and it lets people lock up their crypto, like ETH or BNB, for a set time to earn some extra rewards. It’s a way to make your crypto work for you while you just chill. They started this on February 27, 2025 (yep, today!), and it’s got higher rewards than regular staking, but you gotta commit to keeping your funds in there for a bit. Pretty straightforward, lock it up, earn more, wait it out.

**Kredivo and Gajigesa Deal**

Kredivo, a finance crew, teamed up with Gajigesa in a $12 million deal. They’re blending blockchain with lending to make borrowing easier for folks in Southeast Asia. It’s a smart move that could change how people handle money over there, and it’s cool to see tech mixing into real life like that.
