## Vibe coders, don’t let ops kill your flow

You’re a vibe coder, building dope AI apps, no-code workflows, or services that light up your community. Your MVP is live, users are hyped, but now the grind of scaling is harshing your vibe. Crashes, costs, and tech headaches are stealing your creative mojo.

At Dwarves Consulting, our **platform ops retainer** keeps your platform humming, so you can focus on what you love: creating. Ready to scale without the stress?

## The post-MVP grind challenge

After nailing your MVP, these pain points probably sound familiar:

- **Crashes and lag**: Growing users or data tank your app’s performance.
- **Maintenance drain**: Bug fixes and updates eat up your coding time.
- **Cloud bill shock**: AI models or traffic spikes send costs soaring.
- **Security stress**: Your quick MVP setup isn’t ready for hackers or compliance.
- **AI hiccups**: Unoptimized workflows slow things down or break the bank.

These ops struggles pull you away from building the next big thing. We get it, and we’ve got you covered.

## Our solution: Platform ops that vibe with you

Our **platform ops retainer** is built for vibe coders. We handle the techy stuff, so you can keep creating:

- **Scale effortlessly**: Optimize your cloud and infrastructure for 10x growth.
- **Stay secure**: Lock down your platform with enterprise-grade security and compliance (like GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Cut costs**: Fine-tune AI workflows to save 20-30% on cloud bills.
- **Run smoothly**: 24/7 monitoring and fixes for 99.9% uptime.
- **Future-proof**: Prep for AI agents and enterprise demands by 2026.
