they are list of engagement that we usually do with our clients

### full squad

### partial contractor

### design & architect

## when they reach out
### design & development

the way we look at consulting is where we connect client demands with tech expertise.
and we charge by the cost per headcount or sometime by the weight of the work package, depends on certain condition of each project.

The tech market keeps involve, things clients want to build keep changing but the engagement model will be the same.

### level up

when clients already know their inefficient, some of them need experienced team to jump in to help speed up the learning/adopting process, to level up their team and maybe come along with some early seeding and later acquihire.

### platform operations
this is for projects run into operation or mantenance mode. we will

### when we reach out

my favorite one when we do outreaching is to [apply as a team](apply-as-a-squad.md) or [offer a solutions](inefficiency-arbitrage.md) when we spot out the inefficient in client workflow or tech stack.

the both can fallback to billing model of bill by work package or bill by headcount

### billing model
per work package
  when the requirement is somehow clear, we can make a good judgement or estimation on how the required squad should look like, utilize bits from our experience to speed up the development, and we make a final sum for the client. it might be a module, a software or just a simple problem, as long as both parties have a clear scope on what to finish.

per headcount
  most of projects are continuously developing, clients need dedicated team to
  members at dwarves are vetted carefully, and usually they come from the labs team. we treat them like talent.
  client will receive an up-to-date rate card for available members/talents.
  they will work dedicated for the project.

partial deployment
  > it will be bill by hours

agent as a service
  there's another option we are exploring, is to build software, agent and lend them out, as SaaS, provide solutions with subscription fee.
  it sounds exactly like SaaS, but now if we can come up with a custom agent, we can provide service and charge on usage. It's a mix between tradition SaaS and expertise consulting, just it's not a human, but an agent.
