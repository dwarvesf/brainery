Choosing a technology partner is a big decision. To ease this, we offer a **pilot run**: a flexible, low-risk paid trial. It lets clients experience our services firsthand, see our value, and addresses worries about new teams, contracts, and long-term commitments.

## What is the pilot run?

It's a **paid trial** (2 weeks to 1 month) with a **30% discount**, designed to start a long-term partnership. Clients can test our services, assess expertise and quality, and ensure a good fit without long-term pressure. This period also helps us **calculate team velocity** for better future estimates. Clients retain flexibility and can **stop service anytime** without complicated obligations.

## Addressing client concerns

Clients often worry about delivery, strict terms, underperformance, or ending partnerships easily. The pilot run addresses this by offering a risk-free trial. Clients can work closely with our team, review deliverables, and gain confidence while retaining full control.

## Who qualifies?

Qualification is case-by-case, decided by our sales team based on client needs and partnership potential. The pilot run aims for strong collaboration, not just a discount. Its purpose is a clear, hands-on experience to build trust and a strong relationship.

## Why choose our pilot run?

It simplifies the client's decision and builds confidence. It demonstrates our belief in our service quality and dedication to satisfaction. It's a tangible way to show we deliver results and build lasting partnerships.
