This is where we store and organize proposals and RFCs from our team. Think of this as our collaborative workspace for new ideas, improvements, and significant changes.

Have a proposal to contribute? **Open a PR** with your RFC document. This helps us track discussions and keep everything organized in one place.

For more about our broader initiatives, check out the [main Earn section](../earn/README.md) to learn how RFCs fit into our ecosystem.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document that describes a proposed change, feature, or improvement. It's designed to:

* Provide clear context for why the change is needed
* Outline potential solutions and approaches
* Gather feedback from the team before implementation
* Document decisions for future reference

## Creating a new RFC

When you have an idea that requires team discussion before implementation, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Name it following our RFC file naming convention:
   * Format: `XXX-brief-descriptive-title.md` (where XXX is a 3-digit number)
   * Example: `001-team-structure-changes.md` or `042-new-onboarding-process.md`
   * Use sequential numbering starting from 001
   * Use lowercase letters and hyphens for spaces
   * Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the topic
3. Use the RFC template (see below)
4. Submit a pull request for team review

## RFC template

Copy this template to get started:

```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

**Author:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved | Rejected | Implemented

## Summary

A brief (1-2 paragraph) explanation of the proposal.

## Problem

What problem are we trying to solve? Why is this important now?

## Proposed solution

Detailed description of your proposed approach. Include:

* Implementation details
* Timeline estimates
* Required resources
* Success metrics

## Alternatives considered

What other approaches did you consider? Why were they rejected?

## Open questions

List any unresolved questions that need team input.
```

## RFC process

1. **Draft**: Initial creation and personal refinement
2. **In Review**: Open for team feedback and discussion
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation
4. **Rejected**: Not moving forward (with documented reasons)
5. **Implemented**: Successfully completed

## Best practices

* Keep your RFC focused on a single, coherent change
* Be clear about goals and non-goals
* Consider impacts on all stakeholders
* Respond to feedback constructively
* Update the RFC as discussions progress

The goal is thoughtful collaboration, not perfect documents. Share your ideas early and iterate based on feedback!
