Welcome to Dwarves Notes, a collection of notes for everything we do and operate at Dwarves. Dwarves are a group of technology innovation advocates. This project is a part of our information engine, where we consolidate know-how and expertise from and for our team as part of our MMA system: **Mastery**, **Meaning**, and **Autonomy**.

We believe that behind every success comes great preparation, accumulation and compound every single day. This note repo contains our notes and studies for any upcoming challenges, new tech, hiring, bounty, etc.
