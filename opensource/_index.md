## Open Source

Open source isn't just about free software. It's about freedom to create, to fix, to learn. Think of open source like a public park. Anyone can enter, play, and even help maintain it. But unlike a park, the more people use and contribute to open source, the better it gets. For developers, open source is like training wheels for becoming an engineer. You start by using others' code. Then you fix a bug. Soon, you're creating your own projects. We have a few that we manage:

- [LLM Hosting](https://github.com/dwarvesf/llm-hosting/)
- [Mochi UI](https://github.com/consolelabs/mochi-ui)
- [Hidden Bar for MacOS](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden)
- [Blurred for MacOS](https://github.com/dwarvesf/blurred)
- [Devpod Provider Paperspace](github.com/dwarvesf/devpod-provider-paperspace)
- [NextJS Boilerplate](https://github.com/dwarvesf/nextjs-boilerplate)
- [Go API Boilerplate](https://github.com/dwarvesf/go-api)
- [Prompts for Dev](https://github.com/dwarvesf/prompts-for-dev)

But why does this matter for businesses?

Simple. Open source contributions are a goldmine for talent spotting. They show initiative, collaboration skills, and technical chops. All in public view. At Dwarves, we don't just use open source. We actively encourage our team to contribute. It's not charity - it's an investment in our people and our industry.

We've set up reward policies for open source work. Of course, not with just ICY, but time and recognition too. It's our way of saying, "This matters."
