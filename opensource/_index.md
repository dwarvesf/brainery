So much of the software we rely on every day is built on the backs of open-source projects. We believe wholeheartedly that embracing open source will make our products the best they can be.

But it's not just about the end result. For us, going open source is about the journey. It's about connecting with all of you. We take pride not just in what we build, but how we build it. And we want to share that with you - the elegance of the code, the craftsmanship of the software. We know we'll learn a ton from you along the way and that together, we'll make something even better than we could alone.

That's why supporting open-source contributors and makers is so important to us. We want to do that through community, through recognition, and yes, through cold hard cash.

So we're going to support your open source work in a few key ways:

### The OSS We Love

These are the kinds of open-source projects that really rev our engines:

- **Libraries**: Utilities that let us focus on what matters - building great products
- **Boilerplates**: Templates that give our projects a running start
- **Workflow tools**: Automation that keeps us in our flow
- **Team experiments**: Code that helps us test drive new possibilities
- **Team OSS**: Open-source products built under the Dwarves banner
- **Products we use**: Open-source products the Dwarves team loves

### Ownership Matters

We've realized that a sense of ownership is key to making things better. We naturally put more care into things we own and will even sacrifice free time to nurture them. Software is no different.

So for the OSS projects we support, we encourage you to host them under your own name, unless it's an official Dwarves-driven project. And if you think our community should recognize your contributions, here's what to do:

- **Add [our badge](https://github.com/dwarvesf/badge)** to show your OSS is recognized by the Dwarves community
- **Get credit** by submitting your work to the Dwarves open source [hall of fame](https://github.com/dwarvesf/opensource)

If your open source product takes off, we're happy to assist with launch and distribution to our community.

### Rewarding Contributors

Too often, the tireless maintainers behind the open-source projects we can't live without go uncompensated. It's just not right. So we're putting our ICY where our mouth is:

- **PR to an OSS**:
  - 10 ICY for small improvements or bug fixes
  - 20-50 ICY for new features or ideas
  - 50-150 ICY for major releases or architectural work
- **Publications**: 20-50 ICY for write-ups on tech trends or state of the art
- **OSS products**: 50-250 ICY based on the product's impact on Dwarves members, plus 50-100 ICY/month for maintainers who keep pushing the product forward

> ICY is Dwarves community token. 1 ICY = $1.5

At the end of the day, open source is about the people behind the code. It's about all of you. And we want to recognize, support and reward you for building software that makes all our lives better.

Let's do this thing. ðŸ’ª
