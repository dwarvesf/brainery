## Welcome to Dwarves Memo

Dwarves are a group of technology innovation advocates. This project is a part of our continuous learning engine, where we want to build up the 1% improvement habit, *learning in public*. We believe that behind every success comes great preparation, accumulation and compound every single day. This brainery repo contains our notes and studies for any upcoming challenges.

Written by Dwarves for product craftsmen.\
Learned by engineers. Experimented by engineers.

### Workflow

Applying the Zettelkasten method to construct our reference neuron network, we collect learning pieces from articles, books, papers, videos and then put them here to evaluate before boarding them on our technology adoption radar. We also adopted the LYT method with an initial setup and notes from Moby Diction Publish. It sets a great standard and we find it very helpful.

### Contributing

We encourage our members to read, write, share what we learn with others, and [contributing to the Brainery](CONTRIBUTING.md) is an important part of our learning culture.

For visitors, you are welcome to read them, contribute to them, and [suggest additions](discord.gg/dfoundation). We maintain a monthly pool of $1500 to reward contributors who support our journey of lifelong growth in knowledge and network.

### Dwarves+ Protocol

As we evolve into a decentralized protocol, we're building a community-governed ecosystem that rewards research, development, and knowledge sharing through tokenomics. Learn more about our transformation:

- **[Tokenomics Documentation](misc/tokenomics/README.md)** - Comprehensive guide to our dual-token system
- **[Whitepaper](misc/tokenomics/whitepaper.md)** - Vision and technical overview
- **[FAQ](misc/tokenomics/faq.md)** - Common questions about the protocol
