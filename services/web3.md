We build blockchain systems that solve real problems. As engineers who've been in crypto since 2017, we focus on creating Web3 solutions that deliver real utility, not just riding the hype waves.

## What we build

### Smart contracts & DeFi

- Custom smart contracts and logic on EVM compatible chains
- DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, and asset tokenization
- Yield farming and staking mechanisms
- Cross-chain bridges and interoperability solutions

### Blockchain integration

- Connect existing systems with public blockchain networks
- Indexing nodes that organize blockchain data for queries
- APIs and SDKs for blockchain interaction
- Wallet integrations and payment systems

### Web3 infrastructure

- Architecture design for novel blockchain systems
- Contract auditing and security analysis
- NFT platforms and marketplace development
- Vesting contracts and tokenomics implementation

## What's next in Web3

We're focused on practical opportunities:

- **Real-world utility**: Moving beyond speculation to actual use cases
- **Cross-chain infrastructure**: Making different blockchains work together seamlessly
- **Regulatory compliance**: Building systems that work within legal frameworks
- **User experience**: Making Web3 as easy to use as Web2

## Our track record

We've built Web3 solutions across different use cases. Here are some highlights:

### Payment systems

**Neutronpay** - Built a payment platform on Bitcoin's Lightning Network for fast, low-cost transactions.

**Mochi** - Created Web3 tooling and infrastructure for seamless blockchain interactions.

### DeFi & trading

**[iCrosschain](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/icrosschain)** - Built the fastest cross-chain exchange (15-second transfers). Connected 8 major blockchain networks.

**[Tokenomy](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/tokenomy)** - Helped build their mobile app for crypto investment platform.

### NFTs & gaming

**Eklipse** - Built video-based NFT tooling for game streamers to monetize their content.

**MStation** - Created an on-chain RPG game with blockchain-based mechanics.

### Enterprise blockchain

**[Attrace](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/attrace)** - Built a blockchain referral layer that brings transparency to affiliate marketing.

## Console Labs

Console Labs is our Web3-focused subsidiary handling specialized blockchain R&D:

**Backend**: Go, Node.js, Python for blockchain indexing and APIs

**Web3 libraries**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, wagmi for frontend integration

**Infrastructure**: IPFS, The Graph, Alchemy, Infura for decentralized services

## Why work with us

**We've been here since the beginning.** We started building on Ethereum in 2017, before the hype cycles. We know what works and what doesn't.

**We focus on real utility.** Not every problem needs blockchain. We help you figure out when it makes sense and when it doesn't.

**We understand the regulatory landscape.** Especially in Southeast Asia, where crypto regulations are evolving rapidly.

**We build for the long term.** Our solutions survive market crashes and hype cycles because they solve real problems.

## Ready to build?

Whether you're exploring blockchain for the first time or scaling an existing Web3 product, we can help you navigate the space and build something that lasts.
