**Data processing**: DuckDB, Apache Spark, pandas for handling large datasets

**Observability**: Langsmith, Langfuse for LLM observability and monitoring

**Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services (AWS, GCP) for scalable AI systems

## Why work with us

**We focus on production-ready AI.** We've seen too many AI demos that don't work in the real world. We build systems that scale and stay reliable.

**We understand business context.** AI is a tool, not a goal. We help you figure out where AI actually adds value to your business.

**We're platform-agnostic.** We pick the right AI models and tools for your specific needs, not whatever's trending on Twitter.

**We handle the complexity.** From data pipelines to model deployment, we take care of the technical challenges so you can focus on your business.
