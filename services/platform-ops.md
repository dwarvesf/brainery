We automate infrastructure that scales. As technologists who've seen too many manual deployment disasters, we focus on building platform operations that work in production, not just pretty diagrams.

## What we build

### AI-driven infrastructure automation

- Intelligent DevOps pipelines that adapt to your codebase
- Self-healing systems using AI for anomaly detection
- Automated resource allocation based on real usage patterns
- Smart monitoring that predicts failures before they happen

### Platform operations at scale

- Cloud infrastructure that actually saves money
- Container orchestration that doesn't require a PhD
- CI/CD pipelines that deploy safely, not just quickly
- Observability systems that show what matters, not everything

### Operational intelligence

- AI-powered log analysis that finds real issues
- Predictive maintenance for infrastructure reliability
- Automated compliance monitoring and reporting
- Cost optimization through intelligent resource management

## What's next in platform ops

We're seeing platform operations evolve beyond basic automation:

**AI-first operations**: Moving from reactive monitoring to predictive infrastructure that self-optimizes based on patterns and usage.

**Sustainable infrastructure**: Building systems that automatically optimize for both cost and environmental impact, not just performance.

**Zero-trust operations**: Security and compliance built into every automation, not bolted on afterward.

**Edge-to-cloud orchestration**: Managing workloads that span from IoT devices to multi-cloud environments seamlessly.

## Our track record

We've built platform operations for 10+ companies across startups to enterprises. Here are some highlights:


### Platform modernization

**[Kafi Securities](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/kafi)** - Executed phased platform acquisition and migration. Full technical assessment, smooth transition, and infrastructure modernization for their trading platform.

**[Hedge Foundation](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/hedge-foundation)** - Established centralized monitoring setup for their crypto trading platform. Proactive monitoring, incident management, and system reliability.
- _Tech Stack: Kubernetes, GCP, Grafana, Prometheus, Elixir_


### Infrastructure automation & monitoring

**[Memo](https://memo.d.foundation)** - Built our own knowledge management platform with automated content processing, search indexing, and deployment pipelines.
- _Tech Stack: Github action, DuckDB, Discord messaging_

**[Observer](https://memo.d.foundation/consulting/case-study/brainery)** - Developed infrastructure for a social listening platform with automated deployment pipelines, real-time monitoring, and AI-driven content curation.
- _Tech Stack: Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, Uptime, Sentry, Retool, Go, Python, TypeScript_

## Our tech stack

**Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure multi-cloud. We build systems that scale without breaking the bank.

**AI/ML platforms**: LangSmith and Langfuse for observability, LLMOps for model management. We integrate AI into your operations, not just as an afterthought.

**Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, custom observability solutions. We show you what matters, not everything.

**Automation**: Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions. Deployments that work, not just look good in demos.

**Languages**: Go, Python, TypeScript for infrastructure tooling. Ruby for legacy system integration.

## Why work with us

**We've been in the trenches.** Real experience with infrastructure that melts down at 3am. We know what actually breaks in production.

**AI-native approach.** Not retrofitting AI into old processes, building intelligent operations from the ground up.

**Practical focus.** We measure success by uptime and cost savings, not architecture diagrams.

**We work as your team.** Not as outsourced DevOps, but as your infrastructure co-founders. We care about your systems staying up.

## Ready to automate?

Whether you're a startup drowning in manual deployments or an enterprise wanting to modernize your operations, we can help you build platform operations that actually scale.
